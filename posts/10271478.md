# Ask HN: Softwar Developpement Certificate, what to expect?

I&#x27;m an aerospace engineer, been working for 10 years now and not liking it mainly because of the lack of creativity in this field, big industry, old school mentality, too big to fail (like banking) and extremely inefficient.<p>I don&#x27;t think I have the energy to learn software on my own. I feel I need the structure of academia. I signed up for a certificate in software developpement, hoping that these tools will allow me to apply my math&#x2F;logic skills to solve problems in a creative&#x2F;efficient way. I don&#x27;t really have a specific goal with this certificate, it&#x27;s for fun and to take a break from work.  Where can this take me? Does it seem like the right thing to do? What potential interesting outcomes do you see for my career profile? I&#x27;m taking a shot in the dark...
