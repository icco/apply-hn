# Apply HN: 8Yet? â€“ Social in old fashioned way, i.e. face2face

Problem: Online social networks have killed people&#x27;s ability to have deep, meaningful conversations. People value quantity over quality, speed over depth. We talk in emojis, LOLs, likes, shares because that&#x27;s fast and easy. Teenage girls get up in the morning and reply dozens of snapchats without even reading the content. Fear of missing out has driven us spending hours everyday catching up with all the social feeds. At the end of the day, we&#x27;re still left with an empty feeling that we&#x27;re ever more isolated than ever. When I go out with my wife for dinner, we ran out of things to say in a few minutes. The silence is unbearable and we desperately reached out to our phones as our savior. Voice, the way we communicate to each other for hundreds of years, is facing distinction.<p>Solution: Actually I don&#x27;t have a solution. Changing people&#x27;s behavior is the hardest thing in the world. But I figure we can take baby steps toward fixing the problem by having a tool that allows you to meet up with different people nearby for lunch to practice small talks and regain your ability to talk like it&#x27;s 1995. You can practice the same joke over and over with different audience until you nailed it. Then you can go home and impress your partner.<p>Product URL: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;goo.gl&#x2F;41DhCI
