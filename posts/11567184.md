# Apply HN: Stylefnf – Classifieds for Web 2.0

www.stylefnf.com<p>Stylefnf is a local community marketplace for students, with an emphasis on fashion and furniture.<p>More simply, it’s a website and a mobile app where college students living in downtown Toronto can buy and sell items with other college students.<p>Currently, a majority of students rely on veriﬁed Facebook Groups to buy&#x2F;sell.<p>A minority turn to other solutions (i.e. Craigslist, Kijiji, Etsy, Personal Website).<p>Stylefnf has been built to address 3 key issues for on&#x2F;near campus commerce:<p>1. Existing platforms leave much to be desired<p>• As a buyer, Facebook groups provide an inferior e-commerce experience - it is difﬁcult to ﬁlter through items (too much junk) and even more difﬁcult to reserve&#x2F;purchase via messaging - as a result, deals often fall thorough.<p>2. Fragmented platforms leave individual sellers without an end-to-end solution<p>• As a seller, I need to post daily on 5 different Facebook groups just to reach 20% of the U of T student community - as a result, my items often go unnoticed and unsold.<p>3. Trust &amp; Safety<p>• As a student, I ﬁnd it safer to deal with other students on&#x2F;near campus than strangers - as a result, a minority of students are using Craigslist&#x2F;Kijiji.<p>We&#x27;re a couple of University of Toronto kids trying to solve this problem on our campus, and it looks like this is a problem for many other campuses.
