# Ask HN: How to get into Data Science as a hobby?

I&#x27;ve been programming for about 4 years now (full-stack web) and had a couple previous years doing Database related work (PLSQL, Oracle apps).<p>After taking a few coursera classes on the subject I&#x27;m don&#x27;t know where to turn now.  I had a few classes in college which touched on this (data mining, stats, etc.) but never had any real world projects.<p>I&#x27;m curious..<p>1. Where can I find side projects to work on which I could apply my beginner knowledge of the field. (end goal to learn more with practical work)<p>2. How can I use my background in web development to help advance in this field?<p>Any advice is appreciated
