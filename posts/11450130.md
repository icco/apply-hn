# Apply HN: paralleltext.io â€“ Learn languages by reading

http:&#x2F;&#x2F;paralleltext.io enables a simple way of learning languages by reading and listening human translated books in parallel.<p>Problem: Learning languages is a difficult process that requires hard work no matter if you choose the academic way or to use existing apps. It also requires continuity, a key factor which is hard to achieve with the available methods.<p>Solution: We want to change that by combining the learning experience with the pleasure of reading and listening to a book. A large number of book translations is available, but we think they&#x27;re being underutilized for this purpose.<p>Progress: We built a tool that matches human translated paragraphs from ebooks in all European languages and a novel interface to read them. Now we are focusing on adding more books and more engaging features.<p>Market: Language learning and publishing<p>Team: We are two developers, both with product management experience living in Berlin.<p>Feedback: we got amazing feedback so far (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;InternetIsBeautiful&#x2F;comments&#x2F;3x2tux&#x2F;paralleltextio_improve_your_knowledge_of_foreign&#x2F;)
