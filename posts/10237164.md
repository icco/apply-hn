# Ask HN: I've applied at Toptal and failed the Codility tests

I&#x27;ve made the 3 tests pass but scored 0 at them, I don&#x27;t have experience solving those types of algorithms as I&#x27;ve never had to deal with them before.<p>They said I can apply in one month or two again, what would you guys do? Any advice?<p>Really frustrating.
