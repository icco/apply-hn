# Ask HN: Anyone Has Experience with Adsense Host API?

How easy is to get approval?<p>I am planning to build website similar to http:&#x2F;&#x2F;hubpages.com&#x2F; or http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.bubblews.com&#x2F;.<p>But adsense host api has limitation that we need atleast 100K daily page views even to apply. So my query is till then can we use our adsense account and give out our user 1$ per thousand page views?<p>Is that against adsense policy?<p>After that will it be easy to get approval for host api once we reach 100K PV daily?<p>Thanks in Advance.
