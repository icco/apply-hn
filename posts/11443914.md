# Apply HN: Placewire

Placewire (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;placewire.co) is a new platform for sharing interesting neighborhood information and gossip via photo sharing.<p>Everyone likes good dope about their neighborhood, but when you spot something of interest, it doesn’t fit on the social apps you have today — your sorority brothers on Facebook and the lifestyle pornographers from work on Instagram probably don’t care about the new dog run in your park, or the manhole fire you spotted on your way to the train because you’ve carefully chosen to live far away from such people. On Placewire you follow and post photos into the neighborhoods where you live and work.<p>We&#x27;re launching in NYC in the next 7 days. You won&#x27;t want to miss your chance to grab a low user id which you can subtly lord over people when Placewire becomes literally the first hyperlocal business in history to achieve colossal success.
