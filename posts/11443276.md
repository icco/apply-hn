# Apply HN: Brodlist â€“ a new type of database

Brodlist (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;brodlist.com) is new ground-breaking database that aims to replace the relational database.<p>Its features include Schema-on-Need, so that you don&#x27;t have to model your database, just start using it.  History is built in.  You can query the current state of your data or how it looked a week or month ago just by specifying &#x27;when&#x27; as part of the query.  It&#x27;s performant on commodity hardware and scales horizontally, which is why we can offer it for next-to-nothing.  Because it&#x27;s offered as a REST-ful service where the language is the interface, your API is built-in. What&#x27;s more, the authorization is specified as queries, so you can easily lock down any set of rows or columns for any user.<p>Finally, it uses a new query language that is much simpler.  To get the list of employee equipment in the Sales Department would be queried like this:
Employee.Equipment : Employee.Department = &quot;Sales&quot;<p>The same result in SQL requires this query:
SELECT q.* FROM Equipment q INNER JOIN EmployeeEquipment ee ON ee.EquipmentKey = q.ID INNER JOIN Employee e ON ee.EmployeeKey = e.ID INNER JOIN EmployeeDepartment ed ON ed.EmployeeKey = e.ID INNER JOIN Department d ON d.ID = ed.DepartmentKey AND d.Name = &#x27;Sales&#x27;<p>SQL and the relational database has been around for 50 years.  It&#x27;s finally met its match.
