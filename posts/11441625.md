# Apply HN: CreatorsNest – On-Demand, Private Workspaces for Artists and Creatives

CreatorsNest (CreatorsNest.com) is a network of private, affordable creative workspaces that are accessible on-demand.  Each space, or “nest”, is developed by repurposing residential garages and transforming them into beautiful and inspirational spaces for artists and creatives to use for a variety of purposes.  The goal here is to fundamentally change the way artists work by providing affordable space for creatives, and to disrupt the &gt; $5 bn creative studios industry that capitalizes on artists&#x27; need for privacy.<p>P.S. The first nest was recently opened in Los Angeles.  You can view it here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;creatorsnest.com&#x2F;the-nests.html
