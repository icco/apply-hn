# Apply HN: â€“ Linkedin without the spam

Problem : Only professional networking site out there is also the biggest spammer. Mainly because it serves to Sales and Recruiters more than it does to Users<p>Solution :
A place where users can do the following :
1. Publish their profile, interest and recent work. Ex
direct stream to github projects
blog articles about your work<p>2. Create forms that others need to fill in before inviting. Ex :
DirectConnectForm - just how do i know you field
HireMe form - mandatory fields like company name, comp, location, etc
SellMe form - Product, problem it solves, pricing, demo link, etc
Other customized forms.<p>3. People who are interested to connect with you need to go through one of the forms. These forms define the edge of the graphs
