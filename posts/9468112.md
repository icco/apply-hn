# Ask HN: How do you hire remote employees (not contractors)

hi
lot of startsup are hiring remote which is great. But when it comes to hiring employees, how do handle things like payroll taxes, health insurance etc. if the employee is in a foreign country ?<p>For example, if a US based startup hires someone from say Europe, how will you handle payroll taxes etc for IRS ? What about Insurance etc as those will apply for the home country of the employee, right ?
