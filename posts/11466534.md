# Apply HN: Obaas â€“ OpenBazaar as a Service

OpenBazaar is a brand new, decentralized marketplace. It cuts the middle man and puts all control in the hands of the users. But it comes at a big cost: Users need to install and run software to take part in it. Vendors even have to run the application 24&#x2F;7. And they have to set up their store and all of their products. Obaas takes away all of that pain. All functionality of OpenBazzar is available via a web interface. Obaas automatically imports your products from Shopify, Magento, Ebay or Amazon and sets up your OpenBazaar store. If you already sell products on one of these marketplaces, you will be able to sell on OpenBazaar in 5 minutes via Obaas.
