# Apply HN: The Mirror AI

The idea is to build a neural interface for Artificial Intelligence in Virtual Reality.<p>Sounds crazy but what&#x27;s the point?
Looking at the problem of General AI, recent&#x2F;future advancements in the field are going to deal with a lack of training environment.
I strongly believe that in the future one will need the tools to train AI on how to interact with the &quot;actual&quot; 3D world.
That includes awareness of space (3D sight and sounds), time and touch.<p>While being essential for the general AI development, this would also greatly improve weak AI efficiency.
Given the learned notion of the 3D abstractions and corresponding real-world interactions, one would be able to extract much more meaning from the 2D projections or textual information. Not mentioning human&#x2F;AI interactions that would require strong understanding of the emotions and causal relationships.<p>My background is purely technical with a focus on High Performance Computing and Big Data.
