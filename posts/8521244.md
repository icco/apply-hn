# Ask HN: What companies in London should one apply for an internship at?

I&#x27;m looking for an internship for the next summer. I know how to use Google (or DDG in my case) but I thought asking here wouldn&#x27;t hurt since I&#x27;m sure lots of HN users have experience with past internships in London. Any info at all is highly appreciated!<p>I was hoping Mozilla had an open place in Europe (ideally London) but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case.<p>So, where should I apply?<p>Thanks in advance.
