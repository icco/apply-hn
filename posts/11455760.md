# Apply HN: NextAppointment – automated scheduling of preventive healthcare

“There is no greater imperative in…healthcare than switching from a treatment-oriented society to a prevention-oriented society. Right now we’ve got it backwards. We wait for years and years, doing nothing…until people get sick. Then we spend billions of dollars on costly treaments, often when it is already too late to make meaningful improvements to their quality of life or lifespan.” 
– Richard Carmona, 17th Surgeon General of the United States<p>NextAppointment will integrate patient and doctor calendars to automatically book timely appointments based on established medical guidelines and mutual availability.  We help you find time to make your health a priority.  No more phone calls, or searching for appointments online.<p>Initially, we will be targeting new and expecting parents to promote preventive checkups throughout their children’s lives.  We believe the current mindset of seeing a doctor only when you feel sick is difficult to change; a life event such as the birth of a child may be a sufficient catalyst to initiate and perpetuate this change in behavior, now and in future generations.<p>The idea was very well received based on cold calls made to 50 primary care and pediatric clinics in Toronto, with some generating referrals to other clinics on the first call.
