# Ask HN: Is there a term for a startup in “AiTech”?

It is convenient for investors to be able to categorize startups w.r.t. the IP they are building up. Nowadays, you have FinTech, GreenTech, CleanTech, BioTech, NanoTech, etc.<p>We&#x27;re in algorithms (machine learning, AI) that we apply to a range of applications, let&#x27;s say the current physical automation challenges, such as building automation and robotics.<p>There are now many companies applying interesting algorithms. We all saw startups on HN coming by which focus for example on deep learning, support vector machines, or other machine learning fields that are maturing.<p>Do you know a term for startups like that? SmartTech? AiTech? I think having a good name can boost the number of startups in this direction, which I consider a good thing even if it&#x27;s more competition. :-)
