# Apply HN: Tutorack â€“ Find teachers and courses for everything you want to learn

We are developing an app to let you search and find tutors, institutes, online courses, videos, articles, books, etc. for anything you want to learn - from physics &amp; deep learning to dance &amp; guitar.<p>While similar services exist, they restrict users in what they can search for (only offline tutors or just online courses or just academic subjects) and are mostly listing based services where they charge tutors to list their names. We want to keep it free for the users, including people who list as a teacher, and earn through advertising, affiliate marketing.<p>We already have a working product at www.tutorack.com - however, it still needs a lot of data.<p>Ultimately, we want to create an ecosystem where its super simple for people to sign up and share their knowledge of niche areas. For eg. if you have specialized knowledge in battery technology, maybe you can sign up as a tutor and people interested in learning about this can get in touch with you. This is especially important for countries like India where affordable and accessible education is a big problem. Even with much more educational content being produced, effective discovery remains an unsolved problem.<p>Happy to answer questions and get feedback - thank you.
