# Ask HN: Does MVP apply to Games?

In most of the startup material I&#x27;ve read, there is a fairly constant drumbeat that you want to open your doors once you get your MVP (minimum viable product). I take a look at the current alpha version of my game (playable at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;nawegr.blogspot.com&#x2F;p&#x2F;project-gliese.html), and I wonder if I should setup a landing page to let folks preorder rather than continue to slave away and hope there will be enough buyers at the end to justify the time and investment. On the other hand, I have a hard time believing I could get $29.95 for what I have currently produced. Thoughts?
