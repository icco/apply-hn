# Ask HN: MS vs. Job

Hi HN!
I am a junior undergrad studying CS from a top university in India (IIT). Eventually, I want to start my own business. I did a startup which failed and don&#x27;t have any idea to pursue at this point of time. So, I am confused between getting a job (at a top company&#x2F;startup) and applying for MS from Stanford.<p>If I apply for a MS CS at Stanford, I will get good exposure and experience in silicon valley. Moreover, I love CS and the network and connections may also be beneficial. On the other hand, I cannot work in US for the first year after graduation (since I won&#x27;t have a provisional degree by April&#x27;16 which will be needed for H1B) and even after that, I am not sure of getting the visa. The other option is to join a fast growing startup in India itself but I am not sure about how beneficial it will be.
