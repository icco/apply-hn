# Apply HN: Hackinator â€“ Allow hackers to invest in YC startups using code :-)

Every startup has very tight resources, and yet they often need to add really bright highly paid individuals to their team. Hackinator will allow brilliant hackers to provide code development (or other similar services) to YC startups in exchange for shares in these companies. Startups would be submitting posts such as: &quot;Develop our Android app for 0.1% shares of our startup&quot;. Since the startup has been selected by YC, the hacker will be somewhat confident that the startup has good potential.<p>Note: I am already involved with a startup of my own, but I am gladly offering this idea to anyone interested in pursuing it.
