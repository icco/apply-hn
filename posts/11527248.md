# Apply HN: Clash of stacks – collectible card game for web geeks

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clashofstacks.com" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;clashofstacks.com</a><p>Clash of Stacks is the ultimate collectible card game for web geeks — the goal of the game is to build the best web stack possible with a limited number of cards. Game rules and the stats for each card are determined by public opinionated pull requests. Each card has a public key fingerprint which helps to identify its current owner and check if the card is original or fake.<p>One possible way to monetize this project would be an option to order a high quality printed version of your card(s) or buy a “starter kit” with predefined number of cards.
