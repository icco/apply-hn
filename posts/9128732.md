# Ask HN: How do remote full time jobs work?

Background - I can develop professional web and cross-platform desktop apps. I&#x27;ve only done a bit of freelancing and have no idea about real jobs.<p>1. How will the dev team communicate with me? Email&#x2F;phone&#x2F;Slack?<p>2. What task will I get? How will the deadlines be like? What happens if I can&#x27;t finish them in time? How frequently will I get tasks after finishing old ones?<p>3. How will I get hired&#x2F;interviewed if I apply?<p>I also should point out that I feel really uncomfortable talking on the phone and don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll sound like a human (maybe I&#x27;m slightly autistic). Do people hire by email interviews?
