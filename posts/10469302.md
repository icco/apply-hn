# Ask HN: For those who got an interview, a few questions

First off, congrats on passing the first test.<p>As somebody who is preparing to apply to the next batch (I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be ready for this one), I&#x27;m curious.<p>Was this the first time you applied with this idea?<p>When did you start working toward getting accepted into YC?<p>What steps did you take (possibly outside of the application) to ensure you got an interview?<p>What do you feel made you stand out and get an interview?<p>Anything else you&#x27;d like to tell the rest of us hopeful future YCers?
