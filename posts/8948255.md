# Ask HN: Internship, a villa in Costa Rica, All paid for a month of startup work

I just launched http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.trimpics.com and getting good traction, I am thinking of doing an internship for digital nomads, they will apply by sending a video telling about themselves and I will pick 2-3 people that I think might be a good fit.<p>The idea is to rent a villa down in Costa Rica with all expenses included (including the flights), and bring 2-3 people for a month of growth hacking &#x2F; content marketing and motivate each other to grow the business, at the end of the month if the interns are a good fit then offer them a monthly wage to continue working on my startup from wherever they want in the world.<p>Ideas? Would you join?
