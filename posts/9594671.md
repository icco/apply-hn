# Ask HN: Where can I meet and connect with a technical cofounder?

I live in an area that isn&#x27;t very engaging for tech companies or startups, and so even within my network I don&#x27;t know anyone who could help me.<p>I have an idea I&#x27;ve been working on and have I think fairly fleshed it out, but I have very basic knowledge of coding&#x2F;development. I can read and understand most, but I can&#x27;t create things myself.<p>I&#x27;d really like to apply to a future Y-Combinator batch, but I&#x27;m scared that as a lone founder I&#x27;d be cut out right away, even if my idea is good.<p>Where can I go&#x2F;what service can I use to get connected with skilled potential cofounders?
