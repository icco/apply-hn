# Ask HN: How do I solve problems/code outside of the book I used to learn python?

I learned python (2) via LPTHW about 2 months ago and have had some serious procrastination but now I&#x27;m aiming to get back into the swing of things. However, I now remember what triggered my procrastination: My inability to code outside of the book! It&#x27;s as if I can&#x27;t solve any programming problems.<p>For example:<p>I&#x27;m looking to try and solve this on &#x2F;r&#x2F;DailyProgrammer: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;redd.it&#x2F;341c03 but I just can not do it for the life of me. I can go through all of codecademy and LPTHW but I can&#x27;t figure out something this simple!? Damn it. In my head this is how I would solve it:<p>First you need to grab user input and store it
Next you need to define what consonants are and create a list
If user input contains any of the letters defined in the list (regardless of case) place an &#x27;o&#x27; after the specific letter and add the consonant
Return to above command and check for any other characters, once every character is checked return new output and exit.<p>---<p>But for some reason I just hit a blank wall and can&#x27;t apply this to python, it&#x27;s as if I learn the syntax but not problem solving, or its like I haven&#x27;t really learned programming. Any advice at all would be appreciated as I really want to start being able to do interesting stuff!
