# Tell HN: Hello

Hello All,<p>My name is Mohamed, and I am a jail guard!<p>After a year or so reading HN, I finally made an account! This place is overwhelmingly full of smart people, and I sometimes feel out of place! I have learned a great deal from all of you. With this said, I am embarking on a two year journey to apply to YC in FALL of 2017. I have given myself this arbitrary timeline to motivate myself.<p>You see, I am a total noob. I&#x27;m about to enroll in an online coding bootcamp. This is to grasp enough CS&#x2F;coding experience so I can graduate from the proverbial &#x27;I&#x27;m looking for a technical co-founder&#x27; dilemma, and to build the MVP on my own. What I become, for better or worse, is how I will attract the right people to tell my story and grow a company together. In the meantime, I am working on myself first and learning each day from all of you. I am excited to begin this marathon I call starting a startup.
