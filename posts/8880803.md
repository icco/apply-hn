# Ask HN: Best way to find jobs across the country

I&#x27;m considering moving across the country for preferred climate reasons and would like to try to interview&#x2F;setup a job prior to making the jump. Knowing many companies don&#x27;t consider non local applicants, what&#x27;s the best way to go about this? Enlist the help of a recruiter&#x2F;recruiting agency? Apply and include in the cover letter that I&#x27;m moving to the area so relocation expenses are not expected? Additionally, if I fly out I&#x27;d like to have a few interviews lined up. Thoughts?
