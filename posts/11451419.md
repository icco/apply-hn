# Apply HN: Jury Board â€“ helping attorneys win cases through jury selection

Problem:  Scientific jury selection is limited to the largest firms usually making over hundreds of millions of dollars a year.  When selecting juries, attorneys of other, smaller, firms have only the information they get through asking questions to make their selection.  This can be greatly improved by providing attorneys with a tool that allows them to do data mining from social media and any other sources and aggregate it to a probability of how that juror is likely to vote.<p>A tool that gives an attorney more insight into jurors would be incredibly valuable to them.  If you have millions on the line, paying even a few hundred to get information about a potential jury is a bargain.<p>While giving one attorney a strong advantage, thereby effecting the outcome of a case, can seem questionable, the justice system designed jury selection to be in the lose&#x2F;lose quadrant of possible scenarios.  Ideally a more equitable and fair jury is chosen by both attorneys eliminating those against them as best they can.  This also means though should one attorney have an effective tool selecting jurors others are highly incentivized to use that same tool.  This should produce a strong network effect for my product.
