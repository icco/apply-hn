# Ask HN: How do I get a job at a SV startup as an international?

I am CS student approaching graduation and I would love to work in Silicon Valley and get inspired by the environment and the energy there is around. So I wanted to ask you how to best achieve this goal of mine.
I will be getting my MSc in CS in Italy in April and in May I will be defending my MSc thesis in the US (kind of a double degree), so I thought I&#x27;d stay a week in San Francisco to do some interviews with startups. I know H-1B visas are only issued once every year and there&#x27;s only a limited amount, so how those hiring international usually work? Also, when is the best time to apply for open positions if I will be in SF in the second week of May?
Thank you in advance for any help!
