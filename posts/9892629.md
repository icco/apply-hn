# Ask HN: Build-Measure-Learn. What do you measure? What have you learned?

I&#x27;ve read the lean startup. I&#x27;ve seen people post stories about how they&#x27;ve used it to grow their companies. I still feel like there aren&#x27;t enough specifics out there. Build-Measure-Learn is still this vague concept. So how do you apply it in your business?<p>What do you measure in your product? Why that?
What&#x27;s the last thing you learned from your measurements? How did it change what you built?
