# Ask HN: How do I hire a designer as an indie dev?

I’m about to hire a designer for the first time for Readlang (http:&#x2F;&#x2F;readlang.com).<p>My previous experience is limited to spending $20 on fiverr, see the results here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;@SteveRidout&#x2F;redesign-my-landing-page-for-1000-kudos-72f0cd57c04a#.3g3uz1i7h<p>This time I’m looking for a designer to help with the brand, color scheme, fonts, logo, visual language, (optionally) illustration and to apply this to the landing page. I’ve offered $1000 for this in the above Medium post and on https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;designjobs . The deadline is Fri 22nd Jan. So far I’ve had 33 applications, and would like some tips on:<p>- How to choose the best applicant?<p>- Is this a good approach?<p>- Does the price ($1000) sound reasonable?<p>- How do you find a good designer?<p>These are fuzzy questions, but I’m interested in opinions about this from both sides - designers and those who’ve contracted designers.
