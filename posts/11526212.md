# Apply HN: Nickel is personal financial planning for free

Problem: At a certain age many of us would like to have a financial plan: a plan for savings, investments, insurance, and taxes, for now and into the future. But making a plan is hard. Hiring a professional advisor to make a plan costs on average US$2,000. LearnVest only costs $299, but they only give you a static PDF file.<p>Solution: Nickel is TurboTax for financial plans. You answer some questions and Nickel generates a financial plan. For free.<p>There&#x27;s many ways we could generate revenue, but for now we&#x27;re focusing on improving our design and algorithm.<p>Prototype: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickelhq.com&#x2F;nickel" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nickelhq.com&#x2F;nickel</a><p>About Us: Dan and I have been friends since college at New York University.
