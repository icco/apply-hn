# Ask HN: How I can get a job in “Big Data” technologies (Hadoop, Spark etc)?

Hey All,<p>I know,  at first sight the question seems to be lame. But I am struggling with this for years. By background is &quot;Backend Development&quot;. Mostly used python and also some node.js.
So, I want gradually want to move to work on technologies like Hadoop, Spark etc.<p>I am already doing online course on Hadoop but I don&#x27;t know where to apply my learnings. As my days job is mostly backend development+devops staffs. I applied for jobs which are looking for Hadoop eco system developers but I don&#x27;t get any response as I don&#x27;t have real life experience with these technologies. In general I have 4 years software development and writing only backend code is getting kind of boring.<p>I really appreciate your suggestion.<p>Thanks in advance.
