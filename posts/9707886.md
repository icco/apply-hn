# Ask HN: Can we have internship-only threads?

The last who&#x27;s hiring thread had a few companies who also allowed interns to apply but it was a pain going through them and I still wasn&#x27;t sure if the rest of them are open to the idea at all or not. It&#x27;d be nice to have a separate monthly post for internships.
