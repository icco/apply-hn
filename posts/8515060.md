# Ask HN: How do you organize all your personal data?

I&#x27;ve decided to shape up 4 TBs of mess and I want your insights! What data organization strategies have you settled for? What strategies failed? This is a big topic that few seem to discuss.<p>I have saved webpages (in MAFF file format), eBooks, word documents, wget mirrors of sites, audio recorded with my phone, etc etc. The only thing that&#x27;s really in shape is my Lightroom library and music library.<p>I&#x27;m mostly after the grand scheme, the basic structure of your files (ie. the top level and perhaps the directories following these).<p>Some seem to start by organize by file type (directories for Audio, Video etc) and some seem to organize by source at the top level. Source could be &quot;Me&quot;, &quot;Internet&quot;, &quot;My Company&quot;. The funny cat pictures would go in a folder under the &quot;Internet&quot; directory.<p>You could illustrate your file system layouts by using code, like this:<p><pre><code>  Audio&#x2F;
        Music&#x2F;
        Speech&#x2F;
  Documents&#x2F;
            eBooks&#x2F;
            Web pages&#x2F;
</code></pre>
I use OS X, but I guess these strategies should apply to any OS.
