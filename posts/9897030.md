# Ask HN: We built a website and got traction. Is it enough for the next YC batch?

We built a flight search that is able to outperform other searches in many cases (USP). We also got some good traction over the last weeks...<p>Is that enough to apply for YC? How much traction should we have? Since they are invested in Hipmunk,  is there still a chance? - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;tripdelta.com
