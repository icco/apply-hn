# Apply HN: Testable, the social way to study for standardized tests

Testable is an iPhone game that plays like QuizUp and Trivia Crack but is built to help make studying for standardized exams more fun (like the SAT).<p>Traditional methods like tutors and books are either outdated or too expensive. Testable helps bridge that gap with gameplay and providing all of it&#x27;s content for free. It even adapts to each student&#x27;s needs and targets weak points.<p>The revenue comes from teachers, schools and prep centers where our dashboard can help influence their classes through data and their own content. Our hope is that students find the game intriguing outside of the classroom so that teachers don&#x27;t need to spend valuable time doing evaluations.<p>Our game is out in the App Store for anyone to try out. At the moment, it only serves SAT content (more tests to come soon).<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;itunes.apple.com&#x2F;us&#x2F;app&#x2F;testable&#x2F;id980802068?mt=8
