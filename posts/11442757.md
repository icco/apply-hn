# Apply HN: Coconutâ€“ Baxter for managing organization data

--Story--<p>A while ago I worked in a call center at a university. Their business software was a mess of hacked tools and scripts because their needs were constantly changing. The cool part? The student leads were the ones implementing the business rules.<p>The idea is to build a flexible and fun tool for managing organization data. Things like: call center tickets, work orders, incident reports, media requests, event requests, feature requests, etc.<p>--Business--<p>SaaS. This is a crowded field with many specialized solutions but I believe that the available solutions aren&#x27;t right for many organizations.
