# Ask HN: How you keep your algorithm/data structure knowledge sharpen

The question could be a bit of misleading. Just to give you the idea what I am talking. Here is my story:
Last year I was looking for a new gig and applied in couple of software companies. I have around 4 years SW development experience mostly web applications based on Python&#x2F;JS with unix skill.<p>In the interviews I was really disappointed with myself regarding algorithm&#x2F;data structure problems. In the interviews the coding test and small projects they asked me to complete was good and eventually I got couple of offers from these employers.
But the interviews mostly focused on algorithm&#x2F;data structure I was massive flop and did not get offer from those companies.<p>After completing my bachelor when I was looking for my first job, I was asked almost same algorithm&#x2F;ds problem. At that time I was good but not something overwhelming. Long story cut short, I want to keep my algorithm&#x2F;ds basics keep sharpen though in day job we dont apply most if the staffs.<p>Anyone else have the same issue? How you guys do it ?
Thanks.
