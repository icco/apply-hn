# Ask HN: How come blogs/magazines never get accepted into YC?

I haven&#x27;t seen a single successful blog company apply and get into YC. Why is that? I&#x27;m talking about startups like TechCrunch or Mashable.<p>Or maybe I&#x27;m mistaken and there have been a few.<p>Thanks for any input in advance!
