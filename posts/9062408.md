# Ask HN: Remote Jobs. How to get started?

Dear HN,<p>I&#x27;m a (web) front-end&#x2F;UX-developer from Germany. I&#x27;m finishing my master degree right now and will have to get a job the next months, so I&#x27;m considering remote jobs, since I don&#x27;t want to be bound to my workplace.<p>Most companies in Germany are rather conservative and want their people to be in-house most days a week. In other Europe countries this seems to be only a &quot;bit&quot; better.<p>Can I just apply for jobs all over the world and still stay where I want to work from there? Like USA or Canada?<p>Where do I need to pay taxes then?<p>Do I need a work visa for the countries I live in or the countries I have the job in?<p>If I don&#x27;t want to do contract&#x2F;freelancing work, how is my employment status if I got a job in another country, like the USA?
