# Ask HN: Why all the hubub about type casting?

Hey Nerds,<p>I&#x27;m a pretty young-to-average hacker, at 23, and I&#x27;m curious to get explanations on why so many job specs stress experience in both static and dynamically typed languages.  Now I totally understand that there is a major difference between the two language designs, and you end up doing a lot of different things depending on the language. However, they aren&#x27;t so mutually exclusive as to say that experience in one doesn&#x27;t apply to the other. So why do job listings seem to make such a differentiation?<p>Context: I prefer to script in Javascript and PHP. And I use lots of mixed types. I find it to be the most extendable and convenient. But I also have built apps using Java and Objective C, which are far more strictly typed. And while different, I wouldn&#x27;t say that I specialize in one or the other, they are just very different.<p>If you have written a dev spec distinguishing between language typing, what were you trying to do?
