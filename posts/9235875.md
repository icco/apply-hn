# Ask HN: User telemetry which isn't Google Analytics?

So I, like many, have always been an avid user of Google Analytics on my sites. However I never realised that was seemingly my ONLY option until now...<p>We have a project which will be primarily aimed at children. And while management would love your typical Google Analytics experience, they cannot authorise the collection of data by an external company (both for PR&#x2F;political reasons, but also the lawyers are nervous even with a privacy policy about lawsuits and other state&#x27;s data collection laws (it might rarely apply)).<p>I&#x27;ve been googling around I&#x27;m really not coming up with much. All everyone talks about is Google Analytics or even Microsoft&#x27;s Azure version of the same (Application Insights, which is still externally grabbed).<p>So what are my options here? .Net would be ideal but failing that anything with a Web-API interface will be workable. It just has to be in-house, and not cost a huge sum (because the politics of spending more than the department budget is a headache).
