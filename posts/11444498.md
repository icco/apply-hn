# Apply HN: ChargeGuard â€“ Simple Fraud Prevention for Stripe

ChargeGuard is a simple fraud detection and prevention service that wraps around Stripe&#x27;s client JavaScript tokenization.<p>It is entirely based on heuristics not including card data (for example referrer, user agent, geo ip, browser details, cookies). Users have full control of the heuristics and rules and can interactively create and modify them in real-time.<p><pre><code>   Want to block all tokenization&#x27;s from China? No problem.
   Want to block all tokenization&#x27;s without a referrer. Got it!
   Want to block all tokenization&#x27;s matching a user agent regex. Presto!
</code></pre>
Pricing is pay for what you use... A small fixed amount per API call.
