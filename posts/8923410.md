# Ask HN: How do I find a good start up to apply for?

It&#x27;s been suggested to me numerous times that in order to get a good perspective on work, I should intern at both a large company (i.e. Google, Facebook, Apple) as well as a small company (i.e. a startup). The only issue I have is that I don&#x27;t know where to begin my search for startups.<p>Does HN have any suggestions?
