# Apply HN: PaySQR – the new secure way to pay

Problem – Credit card processing is becoming increasingly complicated for merchants due to PCI compliance regulation and criminals compromising systems with sophisticated malware or physical credit card skimmers.  Merchants don’t have the time or expertise to secure systems properly to combat these threats and generally just want an easy way to accept payments from customers without worry.<p>Solution – using the SQRL protocol which was designed as a password replacement for website authentication see - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.grc.com&#x2F;sqrl&#x2F;sqrl.htm and turn it into a new secure payment system where authentication&#x2F;authorizations are done on the customer’s device.  Since the merchant never has access to the credit card information this will remove the merchant as a target for fraud and eliminate the need for expensive PCI compliance.  For brick and mortar merchants since authorizations are performed on the customer side no internet access would be needed on the point of sales reducing monthly expense and system complexity.  This system would also enable digital payments that have so far been out of reach of most for things like vending machines and laundromats that currently have high threshold to entry and being unmonitored can be easily compromised by credit card skimmers.
