# Ask HN: Where do you look for work if you need experience?

I&#x27;ve done low-level network programming in C, game development with Lua, and for the past 7 months have become a Javascript&#x2F;Coffeescript&#x2F;Node.js web developer ~thing~ (preference for backend).<p>My question is this: Where do you look for work if you need experience?<p>I live in California about an hour by BART from San Francisco..  I have an AS in Computer Science and Computer Networking - and I am out of that community college, but haven&#x27;t yet got the funds to do the university thing.  When I look at job ads I&#x27;m overwhelmed by the expectations and competition.  I feel like I don&#x27;t have a chance, every firm wants the best of the best and I&#x27;m somewhere in the middle?  I apply anyway, but have only scored a handful of interviews (btw I love the people from TypeForm, very pleasant).  I guess I kinda hope that the people posting these ads realize they&#x27;re expecting too much and do want you to learn some amount on the job.  I wish I could be an intern but most positions are unpaid and expect you to be a university student already.  I&#x27;m really trying to avoid working in the fast food industry..<p>I feel like I could be a government worker.  Somewhere you can&#x27;t be fired and you have 3 decades of job security to learn one new skill and apply it (partially) before you retire on a nice pension.  Where are those jobs? :p
