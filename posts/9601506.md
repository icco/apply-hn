# Ask HN: Do you prefer applying to jobs via forms or email?

I&#x27;d love to hear the HN community&#x27;s feedback: when applying for jobs (especially at startups) do you prefer to see a structured application form, an auto-apply method such as LinkedIn, or simply an email address?<p>Is an email address a negative for anyone?
