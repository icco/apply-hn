# Ask HN: Are H1-B visas more likely to be obtained by big tech companies?

A friend of mine has to decide between a large company (e.g. Amazon, Microsoft, Google) and a startup. Both of them are offering to apply for an H1-B visa for him in April 2016.<p>His concern is that the large companies might be more likely to get it.<p>Is that true at all?<p>I tried to google this but didn&#x27;t find any substantial evidence.
