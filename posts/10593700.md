# Ask HN: How to get US H1B visa when located abroad?

I currently work in Software Industry in Product Management role. I completed my MBA from a Top 5 Bschool in US and was working in US for a few years on H1B. After my H1B visa expired, I returned back to my home country. I&#x27;m now thinking about returning back to US, possibly on H1B. How can I get a H1B sponsorship from a US company&#x2F;startup when I&#x27;m currently located abroad? Should I work with some US consultancy which can apply for my H1B visa? Once I get my H1B visa I can have conversation with the US company&#x2F;startup that I want to work with and transfer my H1B visa to them? I&#x27;m confused, please help!
