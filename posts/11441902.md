# Apply HN: Program for Elite Students Before College

Basically the idea is for a curriculum that will be delivered through various means (summer camp program, weekend retreats, high school visits) that is designed for college students interested in BUSINESS in the summer before their freshman year. The curriculum will be designed to greatly increase the likelihood of student success in school, social life, professional career, and personal life. It will cover topics such as study habits, personal training&#x2F;fitness, how to dress well, productivity habits, networking&#x2F;presentation skills, career&#x2F;goal planning, entrepreneurship skills, etc. Much of the value comes from the network created (similar to YC).<p>There are many technology camps like this (that are really expensive) for really smart kids that are hosted by universities. I believe if you offered a strong programming for students interested in business, a lot of value can be brought to them for spending a few weeks.<p>While not a billion dollar business, I believe if it were grown beyond just an in person camp for 50 students, substantial profits could be made delivering the product online or through mini camps spread out in different regions.<p>Let me know what you think.
