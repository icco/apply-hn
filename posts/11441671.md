# Apply HN: Anonymous P2P therapy phone calls (going through a rough time?)

What we do:
We like to think of it as a ‘Anonymous User to User therapy sessions’. We are building a mobile app that allows users who are going through a rough time in their life to be connected to a random person around the world to have a real phone call with.<p>Why:
We all go through rough times. It can be school, love life, or not getting into YC fellowship (hint). Some of these things are very tough to talk about with people you know IRL (judgmental, embarrassing, they don’t care, ect). And we all know for a fact that talking it out with someone and getting advice is a great way to fix problems. This is done much easier when it’s an anonymous person on the other end so you can be 100% free.<p>How it works:
Imagine you just got denied from YC fellowship. You’re there lying in bed all embarrassed and sad, but you can’t tell anyone about it because you’re just not that close to someone else. You pick up Yusuf’s app and automatically connect to a random person around the world who is also going through a tough time. You tell each other the story of what you’re going through and comfort each other. It’s simple as that.<p>Sure, I can talk more about our marketing strategy, product features, monetization, ect. But I’ll let you guys ask those questions (if you want to!)<p>Wanna know more about US (4 founders), past startup experience, more on our product, ect? ASK!!
