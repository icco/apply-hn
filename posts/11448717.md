# Ask HN: What websites does your employer block?

My employer (a large Tech company with about 10k employees) recently blocked every sports related website along with YouTube, Netflix, and every video and music streaming service possible (Spotify, Pandora, Apple music, etc.), citing bandwidth issues as the reason. There was a vague statement claiming they will review this policy in the future. I can understand blocking Netflix, but blocking music streaming services and sports news websites seems ridiculous for a technology company.<p>What websites does your employer block? Should an employer block any websites?
