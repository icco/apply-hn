# Apply HN: Kohapp â€“ Helping friends hangout without the hassle

We are trying to make it easy for friends to hangout with each other and have fun. There are various instances where we decide to hangout with our friends but face the following problems in doing so:<p>- Long calls&#x2F;texts&#x2F;chats to decide on a place to meet and even after all that there is no surety that a decision is made. This is the biggest problem while planning a hangout.
- No easy way of checking which all friends are coming and which are not.
- Deciding on a date&#x2F;time that suits everyone.<p>Even if going through all the above problems was not enough while planning, there is one other major problem at the actual hangout place. We all have those friends who never reach on time and we end up calling&#x2F;texting&#x2F;chat (again) to enquire about there ETA (everyone hates to wait :))<p>All these issues are not only painstaking but a waste of time as well. Kohapp helps to solve all of them under one roof through the help of technology. Its an app to plan&#x2F;organize hangouts in 3 simple steps without need of calling&#x2F;text&#x2F;chat.<p>We are currently in development and hope to launch in the coming months.<p>http:&#x2F;&#x2F;facebook.com&#x2F;kohapp
