# Apply HN: An app that teaches people how to code and make apps

Hello internet,<p>I am the founder of We Heart Swift - one of the first swift only websites&#x2F;blogs - we have about 50k monthly visitors on the site.<p>I&#x27;ve learned how to code by myself at age 10 by reading the help section of Borland Pascal. In high school I&#x27;ve been a competitive programmer and even got a medal at the international olympiad in 2009. I&#x27;ve always been interested in teaching others how to code and trough We Heart Swift I think I found a way to make it sustainable.<p>Our main product is an learning platform similar to codecademy. Its not web based, instead it builds on top of xcode and playgrounds in order to give feedback to the user.<p>The first version teaches people how to code in one month - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.weheartswift.com&#x2F;swift-programming-scratch-100-exercises&#x2F; - it has close to 1000 users. At the moment we are working on the second version of the platform which offers a similar experience on iOS.<p>Beside people on the internet wanting to make apps or learn how to code we have been contacted by a few universities and programming bootcamps for bulk purchases.<p>If you have any questions please let me know :)
