# Ask HN: Recommended books for beginner web developer

I&#x27;m a long-time biz guy and I&#x27;ve recently started learning PHP (I already know HTML&#x2F;CSS).<p>For my first real-world project, I want to work with a JSON api, analyze some data in the api, and display the data on a site.<p>The books I&#x27;ve read so far have taught me all about variables, functions, arrays, etc, but I feel I don&#x27;t have a good sense of how to actually apply this knowledge yet.<p>Any good recommendations?
