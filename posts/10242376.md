# Ask HN: Which diplomas/certificates to make me able to get a TN visa?

Some context:<p>- I am a Canadian citizen<p>- I applied to Amazon for a position at their Seattle HQ<p>- I passed all the interviews and received an offer for a FT position<p>- Amazon Legal advised my recruiter that since none of my past education is programming-related (plus I only have 5 years professional experience) I would most certainly denied entry to the U.S. on a TV visa.<p>- After weighing my options (and after Amazon attempting to place me in similar positions in Canada) I took an offer from another company in my hometown.<p>- Amazon suggested I take some courses to get enough schooling to meet U.S. TN visa requirements.<p>Question:
What are the best courses (online, preferably) to get a ~2 year diploma&#x2F;certificate so I can make my visa application more appealing if&#x2F;when I re-apply for American-based positions?
