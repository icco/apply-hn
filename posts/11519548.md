# Apply HN: Doypp – Content-Driven Mobile Applications on Demand

https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doypp.com<p>Problem: It is hard to build, ship, and maintain end-to-end mobile applications. It is even harder and more expensive for people who don&#x27;t code.<p>Doypp: We want to make technology accessible and affordable for everyone, help people and businesses use mobile to improve workflow. Users can create mobile applications on demand, see result immediately instead of waiting for weeks or months. We developed a technology that allows users visually define own data model and user interface, set access control individually if needed, and launch the whole application right away. The application contains a cross-platform mobile app, a real native Android app, a cloud-based server with build-in user registration, and an admin gui for content management. It can be modified or extended at any time, even after launching.<p>There are quite a few “no-coding mobile app builders” on the market. But check out our demo apps to see the differences:<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;doypp.com&#x2F;demos&#x2F;cit<p>Love to answer your questions, comments and to take feedback.
