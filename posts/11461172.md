# Apply HN: RoomEase â€“ Ease and organise flat sharing

<i>Problem</i> : Until now flatmates end up using different apps for communication, shopping lists, task organisation, social planning, house finances, reminders and house service delivery. That&#x27;s too many apps!<p><i>Solution</i> : We are building a product that consists of two parts: [A] a platform for flatmate collaboration, organisation and socialising that [B] integrates with an online marketplace of tasks and services towards that goal.<p><i>Features</i> : 
[A] Users can organise everyday house duties and shopping, communicate with their flatmates (in-app messaging), plan house gatherings (socialising), manage house expenses and billing 
[B] In addition, we will integrate a marketplace that allows users to ask people (neighbours, professionals) to provide their services for house duties or other tasks and an admin platform, where landlords can manage issues raised in each house. 
In the future we are planning to embed an intelligent house assistant that will be accessed through a conversational UI.<p><i>Demo</i> :
