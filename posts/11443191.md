# Apply HN: Undercontrol.io â€“ IoT platform powered by affordable hardware and AI

Undercontrol.io is an IoT platform that provides an open-source SDK and plug &amp; play hardware to easily connect sensors and actuators for monitoring data, controlling processes and triggering actions. Our aim is to optimize processes by implementing machine learning with the data gathered from the devices connected to our platform. To achieve this we want to offer affordable hardware and turn it into a commodity to reduce the barriers to entry of implementing IoT solutions.<p>We&#x27;re excited to announce that we JUST launched out of beta and are on production, we saw this opportunity as a way to get feedback from the community.<p>Feel free to ask us anything and if you are looking to make your new IoT project with us, we are very happy to help guiding you on how the platform works. We currently support MQTT, HTTP GET, POST requests and email alarms too.<p>Also, we have a bunch of sensors and actuators, if you have any interesting idea let us know and we can develop it now as we speak :-) (can provide a video).<p>Website: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;undercontrol.io
