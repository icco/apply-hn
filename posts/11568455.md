# Show HN: Actuame, LinkedIn for indie movie makers and freelance artists

Hey HN!<p>Link: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;actuame.com<p>I&#x27;m Mauro, CEO&#x2F;Founder of Actuame.com, &quot;LinkedIn for indie movie makers and freelance artists&quot;.<p>Our product is simple and straight forward. Artists can create their online resume and attach their portfolio and professional information such as courses, education and more.<p>And on the other end, we can movie makers who are in the lookout for new &amp; fresh talent to occupy roles in their projects.<p>At the moment, we allow artists to apply to open casting calls and we let the conversation flow from there.<p>We&#x27;re currently with our MVP, providing service to 3K users (without any funding) and growing!<p>I&#x27;d love to know what HN thinks of the idea!<p>Thanks
