# Ask HN: How to solve US immigration for a foreign cofounder?

I have several offers to join a US-based startup as a cofounder&#x2F;CTO. Hence, I&#x27;m trying to figure out a way how I can stay in US to work on my startup.<p>I did some research and talked to the lawyers, and their seems to be no straightforward way to do this.<p>To summarise, options are:<p>- find a job, wait for H1B until Oct next year and then work on my startup part time<p>- apply for a degree and study for 1-2 years, then have a year to look for a job without restrictions. Work part-time on the statup in the meantime<p>- O-1, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m eligible myself, but I know some entrepreneurs who pulled it.<p>I don&#x27;t see a direct way to solve the immigration issue though. I think this should be a quite common case, so I&#x27;m curious how other hackers solved it. I&#x27;d really appreciate any legal hacks available, as the situation seems rather hopeless at this point.
