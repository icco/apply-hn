# Apply HN: Polymyr â€“ Bring Your Product to Life

http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.polymyr.com<p>Consumer reviews are preferred by a 3-to-1 margin over press reviews. Polymyr capitalizes on that and is a social product testing&#x2F;launch platform that offers hardware startups valuable user experience insights by incentivizing our members, through rebates which you decide upon, to test and review your product. We aim to significantly improve the current launch process by giving new products superuser-level reviews right from the start.<p>For example, Product X is currently retailing for $199, our members will buy it for its full price, they&#x27;ll see how much of a rebate they&#x27;ll receive after they submit their product review, we collect and analyze all their reviews on our platform, send Company X all the reviews, and provide recommendations based on those reviews. For each unit sold, we only ask for a small commission.<p>In summary, we help you promote and sell your product, reach new audiences, collect valuable consumer insights, and give you recommendations.
