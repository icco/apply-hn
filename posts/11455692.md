# Apply HN: AskWhen – An Executive Assistant for Everyone

We’re building a calendaring system that treats people&#x27;s schedules as a constraint satisfaction problem.  Most calendaring software (gCal, Outlook, etc.) does an excellent job of ensuring people know when &amp; where they are supposed to meet and aren&#x27;t double booked.  However, they do a poor job of ensuring that people are able to make the best use of their time.  Indeed, one of the main tasks of executive assistants is to play &quot;Calendar Tetris&quot;, actively managing the schedules of busy executives in response to new meeting requests and an exec&#x27;s high level directive as to how they want their days to be structured.<p>In contrast, with our system, a user specifies with whom they want to meet and a time frame in which a meeting needs to happen.  Our software will then automatically find an opening, adjusting participants&#x27; schedules as needed to make space for the meeting.  More generally, our software takes the place of a calendaring assistant: users paint a broad picture of how they want their days, weeks, and months to look (ex. what gets priority, when meetings need to happen, who needs to be invited, where meetings should be held, etc) and we work out a specific schedule that best fits those needs.<p>By understanding the “who, what, when, where, and why” behind each calendar event, we’ll make sure people spend less time coordinating, and more time doing.
