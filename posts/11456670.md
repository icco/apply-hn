# Apply HN: Statistics as a Service

Basic Concept:
Provide simple-to-use, basic, automated statistics to a user based on an uploaded file (e.g. a CSV) to help them spot trends, data anomalies, etc. Deliverables would be either a PDF report or JSON according to user selection  (possibly with actual cleansed data used to generate the results).<p>This is in the idea stage.<p>Business Model:
Freemium<p>Pricing tiers:
1. Free
2. Pro (additional, more advanced statistical smörgåsbord* to choose from, suggested stats to run, etc.)
3. API (programmatic access to FREE and PRO tier stats)
4. Custom (could be custom stats implementations w&#x2F; API access, more of a consulting project, or even, a statistician on call, etc.)<p>* Though, initially the options would start relatively small, and be added to as time progresses and it makes sense to do so.<p>Use Cases:
1. Knowledge worker at a SMB or local government entity with little access to data analytics or statisticians, but still need to make use of statistics.
2. Dev shops needing stats, but don&#x27;t have the time, in-house resources, etc. to bother with it.<p>It is <i>not</i> an attempt ...
* at big data analytics
* at building an AI&#x2F;ML service
* to be a replacement to R, Python, Julia, et al.
