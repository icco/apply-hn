# Apply HN: Want hire a car at the best price? but tired spending hours in search

When I look to hire a car, first I look on rental&#x2F;search web site then the main rental provider and do comparison, I spend few days doing it hoping to get the best price. But I still think the price I pay is too high.<p>I was thinking what if I submit a request with options&#x2F;features I would like and a threshold price for the car, in return I get personalized bids from local dealers.<p>Fill one form, takes couple minutes, leaves dealers to come back to you with bids, what left? choosing the one you want.
