# Apply HN: Wanderlust – Pandora for Travel

Wanderlust is a website that helps you find out where you could travel to based on how much you can spend. A new way to plan and book your trips and an answer to the question of ‘<i>where should I go?</i>’.<p>The majority of traditional online travel websites (e.g. Booking, SkyScanner) work under the assumption that you know where you’re going. But what if you don’t know this? We don’t always have a destination in mind, but what we typically do have is a general sense of how much we can spend, what we like to see, and when we’d like to travel. Taking these variables into account, Wanderlust provides you with a complete trip - including destination, flight, accommodation, and an overview of the best things to do and see while you’re there.<p>To be sure, it’s still a little rough around the edges, but here&#x27;s a quick demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vid.me&#x2F;TnZL<p>Our Product Hunt feature a while ago: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.producthunt.com&#x2F;tech&#x2F;wanderlust-pre-launch<p>Happy to answer any questions you may have!<p>(A bit about the team:
