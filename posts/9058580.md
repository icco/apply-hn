# Ask HN: This is my first startup, what do you think about it?

Hi everyone, I&#x27;m a mechatronics engineer working on my first startup and I&#x27;m kind of nervous about how should I do things for getting initial traction and to launch. I&#x27;ve read a few books about it, we use the lean startup methodology, I&#x27;ve watch a lot of entrepreneurship video blogs, conferences, YC online startup classes and now I&#x27;m trying to apply all that knowledge in practice, that&#x27;s why your feedback will be a major help for my team and I.<p>We&#x27;re working in this mobile app focus in connect sellers with the people who want their products&#x2F;service immediately by personal messages, no middle men, just a direct conversation between sellers and buyers, we call this app... Sellow.<p>The app will be available to download the third week of March and I want to know what you think about the work that my team and I are doing.<p>You can visit our home here: http:&#x2F;&#x2F;sellow.me<p>thanks and all the best!<p>Israel
