# Ask HN: Sharing a Dropbox folder with customers?

I have a video game I am working on in UE4 that I would like to share with my alpha&#x2F;beta testers. I tried my hand at writing my own ftp solution in .NET that would keep a manifest file with file names and hashes and update accordingly. But I would like to spend my time developing my video game, not reinventing dropbox for enterprise..<p>Does anyone know if it is possible to use the Dropbox API to create a simple client that will use a Dropbox folder as its backend to retrieve files? Ideally use the built in revision system to try to step forward&#x2F;backward through versions of my game?<p>Or might anyone recommend another service to accomplish the same? (Steam is still too early to apply for)
