# Apply HN: Alternative to Advertisement

Advertisement works very well for the status quo that has lot&#x27;s of money to spend on advertisement.<p>Wouldn&#x27;t be awesome for new small companies to be able to focus less on advertisement and more on the product?<p>How? By having an online listing of products with tagging and up-&#x2F;down-voting.<p>For example, imagine a new smartphone manufacturer creates a new awesome smartphone.<p>Instead of spending money on advertisement, the new smartphone company would publish its new smartphone on this online listing. Let&#x27;s call this online listing &quot;listing-platform.com&quot;. Then the following would happen:<p>1. Because the smartphone is new it gets on the landing page of listing-platform.com<p>2. Because the smartphone is awesome it gets lot&#x27;s of upvotes by the community (Similarly to news on Hacker News)<p>3. In the future when users are going to look for a smartphone, they will see this smartphone because of its upvotes and good reviews.<p>This &quot;popularity boost&quot; could eventually be good enough to market new products. Without the need of advertisement.<p>Product Hunt is similar and it&#x27;s quite nice. That said Product Hunt&#x27;s focus is on the consumer side. The focus here is on the producer side. The goal here is to allow companies to market new products without the need of advertisement.<p>Feel free to comment negatively
