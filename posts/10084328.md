# Ask HN: How Should I Apply Thermal Paste?

The Internet is quite confusing on this topic. Some say you should apply just a pea, some that you should spread it with on applicator on the whole surface (hence creating &quot;evil&quot; air bubbles?). They can&#x27;t even agree on which part you should apply the thermal paste on: the CPU or the cooler? Thanks a lot for your input.
