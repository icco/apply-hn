# Apply HN:Programmable matter

Goal: creation of programmable matter, consisting of many microscopic particles (c-atoms). Which can be manipulated to create a user programmed 3d form.<p>Achievements. Verified experimentally:<p>- ways to connect c-atoms with each other;<p>- the movement of c-atom relative to other c-atoms.<p>The experiments were conducted with models of c-atoms in the macro scale. The size of c-atoms models was 3 * 4 cm.<p>Tasks:
- development of software capable of managing an array of c-atoms;
- repeating experiments in micro-scale with size of c-atoms - less than one millimeter.
