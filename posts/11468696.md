# APPLY HN: ScriptDrop-On Demand and in Workflow Prescription Delivery

On demand prescription delivery. The issue with most of the currently available options is that they require the pharmacist and&#x2F;or patient to download an app.<p>Through ScriptDrop&#x27;s partnerships and industry knowledge pharmacists can request a delivery in workflow and not have to download a third party app. ScriptDrop is HIPAA compliant and safer than anything on the market.<p>At scale, we will be free to pharmacists and patients!<p>Here is a short video about the service: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;vimeo.com&#x2F;158900359<p>We have applied to YC S16 and we&#x27;re hoping for an interview invite.<p>Any questions, let me know!
