# Apply HN: Fringe- Simplified Scheduling for Groups

Problem: 1) Scheduling a dinner with a group of friends is a nightmare. 2)It takes 30-50 texts for 3 or 4 people to decide on a time. 3) I hate polling apps...it&#x27;s a spreadsheet that shows all my guesses of when I hope people are free.<p>This is where Fringe comes in. It takes less than 5 taps to know when you&#x27;re group of friends (6 or less) can ALL go to dinner. We are in a public beta so please we need beta users and tons of feedback.<p>How it works:<p>You pick the friends, location
We&#x27;ll suggest the best times that work for EVERYONE.<p>It&#x27;s sent to your friends like a paperless post with a personal note from you.<p>Fringe is like an automated doodle and the personal touch of paperless post.<p>Would love any and all Feedback!<p>to download:
