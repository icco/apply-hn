# Tell HN: Free Domains

I would LOVE to apply for the next round of YC driven by the community. Unfortunately, I can not due to family obligations.<p>However, I can HELP!
I am the founder of OpenDomain - we are &quot;Open Source for domains&quot;.  We would love to contribute a domain to a startup.<p>If you want a Big Data startup, you can use NoSQL.Com.  Or if you want to disrupt hollywood, try www.Free.TV (Justin Kan once called me to get this domain but ended up going with Justin.TV)<p>We have contributed dozens of domains to open source - including Drupal.Com, EcmaScript.Org, and OsCon.com - I would love to help your next startup!
