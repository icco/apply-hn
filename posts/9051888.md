# Ask HN: Software Engineer + DUI: What's going to happen to my career?

Last year, I ushered in my mid-thirties with a personal crisis culminating in a first offense, misdemeanor DUI. How much is this going to impact my career?<p>I&#x27;m a software engineer with a reasonably good resume, advanced degree from a well known school and I&#x27;m highly productive.<p>I know every job I apply for in the future is going to have a checkbox about misdemeanors on the application. How much do I need to fear it?<p>Has anyone had experience with applying for software jobs with a record?
