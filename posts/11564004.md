# Ask HN: How to more efficiently claim unemployment?

Right now I&#x27;m claiming unemployment. I&#x27;m not really super psyched to get a job. I&#x27;m more interested in learning new technologies and exploring other opportunities.<p>Right now my routine every week is to apply to 5 jobs that are vaguely within my qualifications on a software job site, then claim unemployment on the goverments web site by copying that information over and checking a few radioboxes. Its not very high effort, but its a flow interrupted, and its about 30 minutes to an hour of boring work a week, that would conceivably go on for 16 more weeks.<p>Is there an easier way to have applied to 2 local companies + 3 other companies every week, and ideally fill out the UI form as well? I&#x27;m thinking of something like a very low friction job application system combined with some web automation maybe.
