# Apply HN: Let's – Meet amazing people, do fun stuff

Let&#x27;s is a mobile app that aims to facilitate people meeting other great people nearby to do fun stuff like grabbing a drink, having a bite, going site-seeing and more!<p>Unlike other social apps similar to Tinder, Hinge, and more, Let’s takes a focus on activities. On Let’s users create activities for which they would enjoy having company and specify certain preferences regarding the type of partner they would enjoy joining them. Eg.) The partners age, gender, etc.<p>Users can also choose to seek activities nearby to join in which case they are shown the listed activities and can show interest in joining those users by swiping left or right.<p>With Let&#x27;s we believe we can facilitate fun and easy real life meets in short time frames that can result in networking, relationships, social enjoyment and overall fun.<p>Let&#x27;s is currently in development and we aim to launch this summer. Ask anything, we enjoy questions, challenges and any constructive feedback. Thanks!
