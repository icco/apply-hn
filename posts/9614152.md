# Ask HN: How to find dev work before starting University

Hi, I&#x27;m trying to keep it short. I&#x27;ve finished a 6 month (Front End) internship and they offered me to work there part time, but for the last month they didn&#x27;t had any work available, so I&#x27;ve started to look for another job. I&#x27;m going to start to study CS in October and I want to get more experience till then.<p>The jobs that invite me for an interview are agencies that work with WordPress or simple static sites. I don&#x27;t feel that this is going to push me to the edge where I have to learn new things and improve my skills.<p>And real IT companies just reject me, I&#x27;ll show them some small projects (e.g. Node and Angular) but they just don&#x27;t consider me. Mainly because I don&#x27;t have a degree or not even a little formal CS education (In Germany they&#x27;re pretty conservative in this point).<p>Do you guys think it would make sense to try to apply for a remote position? What is my best way to try to get a job at a company&#x2F;startup where I can work with a team on one project?<p>Thanks in advance
