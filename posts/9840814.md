# Ask HN: How to get a job/an internship in programming with EE background

Hi,<p>I&#x27;m currently doing a combined BSEE&#x2F;MSEE with a strong focus on software (mostly MATLAB, C and Python) and I was wondering how to get a job&#x2F;entry position in programming. In school, we do a lot of coding with multimedia (think audio, video compression, wavelets) and telecommunications (i.e. LTE, 802.11, SIP, RTP). I&#x27;m having a hard time finding openings for these skills. I&#x27;d like to start doing some work on the side and gain experience while I&#x27;m completing my degree and writing my thesis, but most companies only accept candidates who already graduated. Does it makes sense to apply to positions whose requirements I don&#x27;t fully fulfill and see if I can wager an internship from that? OR maybe complete my degree and hope that they don&#x27;t want any work experience? I&#x27;d be grateful for any ideas&#x2F;pointers!<p>Thanks!
