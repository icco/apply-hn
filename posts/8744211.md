# What should my expectations be for a software developer internship?

Hi, I&#x27;m currently in the process of trying to find a quality internship to apply for next summer. I would prefer one in NY but I&#x27;m open to working in other states as well.<p>I know C++, Haxe, and Java at a decent level. What should I be looking for and what should I be avoiding (pay&#x2F;workload wise) when I apply?<p>If this doesn&#x27;t fit HN then I can get rid of the post.<p>Thanks in advance!
