# Ask HN: Best ways to approach online dating (from a site design perspective)?

What are the best ways to theoretically approach online dating? Not personally, but from a site design perspective. Some sites might want the users to &#x27;Like&#x27; each other in order to unlock the messaging service, others want you to answer questions (OKC) to highlight the match factor, etc.<p>It seems the main problem, aside from the chicken and the egg, is women don&#x27;t really participate (or perhaps reciprocate is the right word), yet they have gone through the trouble of creating an account.<p>Using a hetero context as an example, wouldn&#x27;t the best way be to use a free credits system where women get 5 credits per month (meaning they can contact up to 5 men) and men get 2 such monthly credits (in order for the women to not get bombarded)? To make this potentially viable, the site would also have to apply a &#x27;use it or lose it&#x27; solution...that is, use the site actively or else your profile gets deactivated (not deleted, per se) or less visible for a certain amount of time as a penalty.<p>Are there better ways?
