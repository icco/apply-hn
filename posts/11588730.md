# Tell HN: Apply HN applications now closed, let's discuss the next step

Applications for Apply HN closed a few hours ago. Now we need a way to sift through the threads and give the community a final say.<p>A few users have suggested that we create a list of applications that had the most interest, then run a poll to let the community produce a final ranking. That seems reasonable, so we can tentatively consider that the default plan, depending on what other ideas appear in this thread.<p>Unfortunately I have to be offline most of today, but I&#x27;ll read and respond to the comments here tonight.<p>Edit (11 PM Pacific): I&#x27;m back now but just too tired and need time to think about this. Sorry. More in the next couple days.
