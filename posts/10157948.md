# Ask HN: Just want to make $1,000/mo from my SaaS, competing on price?

I aspire to be an actor, and I need a flexible job so I can audition anytime. I decided to start an SaaS startup. I&#x27;m currently a server at a restaurant, and the scheduling process is terrible -- excel sheets, manual paper schedules, etc. So I believe I can build a scheduling app that works and that restaurants actually use.<p>The market seems pretty saturated&#x2F;crowded with little to no differentiation. In fact, it seems almost as if they&#x27;re just competing on who has more features. As a solo founder who&#x27;s just building a lifestyle startup, I don&#x27;t want to go down the features route.<p>I plan to differentiate based mainly on ease of use (intuitive design, less irrelevant features that just simply don&#x27;t apply to smaller restaurants) and price. Competitors now average $30&#x2F;mo. I&#x27;d undercut them and take $20&#x2F;mo for a simpler, no-bells-and-whistles solution.<p>There has to be an underserved market segment of really small restaurants (&lt;10 employees) that would use my site instead, I believe. Or is this wishful thinking?<p>PS I once started an SaaS site that made about $1,300&#x2F;mo at its peak, way less now though due to my disinterest (I took a year-long road trip, did loads of random stuff, had a YouTube career, wrote a book, etc. etc.).
