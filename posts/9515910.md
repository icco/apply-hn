# Ask HN: How do you read your programming books?

Hello HNers,<p>When you buy a new programming book, how do you read it? More specifically:<p>* Do you write the code or just &#x27;compile it on your mind&#x27; and go?<p>* Do you re-read the same chapter over and over again if you feel that you missed something, or you go forward even if you feel something is missing?<p>* Do you do all the exercises listed at the end of every chapter (this doesn&#x27;t apply to every book, but most programming books do have exercises)<p>I&#x27;m curious, because usually by 50% of the book I feel that I can do <i>everything</i> I wanna do and my attention drops. I just wanna start my project using book&#x27;s X framework&#x2F;language.<p>ps. I&#x27;m generally speaking a <i>slow reader</i>. I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that I literally read &#x27;slow&#x27; and it bothers me speeding up my <i>natural reading rhythm</i> but it also bothers me the fact that my GF usually finished the page&#x2F;article while I&#x27;m still in the middle. On the positive note, I read much more carefully most of the times. I&#x27;ve seen people here stating that they read Flanagan&#x27;s JS book in 5 days... Which to me seems kinda impossible (if you have no prior DEEP knowledge of JS and OO programming).<p>Regards :-)
