# Ask HN: Thoughts on my recent project?

Software aspect: Archived text chat, voice and video chatting, support larger groups of people in all of these. Sort of a more modern IRC.<p>Site aspect: People can create groups for various reasons, such as professional groups or people with similar interests, and users can browse groups and can apply to join them.<p>Built for hobby groups, professional groups, groups of friends, gamers... anyone who spends a lot of time online with friends or others that communicate often.<p>As a person who gamed a lot before college, friends and I used skype to communicate and a better platform would have been amazing.<p>Could do a free - ad supported version and a premium version. As more and more people spend more and more time online, this sort of a platform will become even more useful to people. And if you can drive significant traffic through the site where people find groups, it is easy to push them towards the software. People love to be part of groups.<p>Please I am just looking for feedback&#x2F;thoughts on what I am currently working on. I think the real value is in the website aspect, as there is no current way to join a group of people interested in a similar topic except by already being well involved in a community.
