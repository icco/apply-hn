# Ask HN: Networking in the bay area

I am coming in March for pleasure but I also want to find a way to promote my startup that I hope will be live by then. Of course I will apply to all accelerators but can I do something more? Any ideas? Go to what kind of meetings ? Can I pitch some early stage VC&#x27;s while I am there?<p>Any help appreciated
