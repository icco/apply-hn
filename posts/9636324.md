# Ask HN: What is an innovative, exciting medical device company?

I will be looking for a job in a year and Iâ€™m looking for some ideas of exciting medical device companies I should eventually apply to. I am interested in companies that are doing really exciting hardware projects and possibly pushing the limits of technology. Some examples that I have in mind right now are: Intuitive Surgical, Alfred Mann Foundation, and Google Life Sciences.
Thanks for the ideas!
