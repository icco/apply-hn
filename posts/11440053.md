# Ask HN: Apple Cannot Call Me (Twilio?) 976?

I&#x27;m applying for the Apple Developer Program; I&#x27;ve just got a DUNS number.<p>DUNS had issues contacting my main company phone number; it&#x27;s an 855 number. We were able to power through it when I called them back from my mobile.<p>Now, Apple also cannot place calls to my 855 number.  Of course I can call Apple but when they try to dial that number there is no connection.<p>My telephone number is hosted in Twilio; anyone else had issues with Apple calling Twilio?<p>My 855 number has the prefix 976 in it.  Historically 976 was a toll prefix.  Maybe that is blocking (via toll-restricted dial on the PBX) DNB &amp; Apple phone systems?
