# Ask HN: Need advice: Single founder and Early stage chances with YC?

Earlier today I asked fellow hackers about their take on my app. But, just in the matter of hours my situation changed dramatically.<p>We were a team of two founders, me being the developer and the other cofounder, a marketing&#x2F;sales girl. Ours&#x2F;mine is a crowdsourced based non-profit startup in its early stages of development.<p>Due some reasons, she quit on the startup and I am now the only founder left in the company, I&#x27;m really determined to go ahead and apply for YC.
I have been working relentlessly to get to a shape.<p>I was wondering if this happened to anyone before and if yes- how did you manage to compensate the loss(may be for a good reason).<p>PS: For the curious, here is my original ask hn: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9267658
