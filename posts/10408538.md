# Ask HN: Technical interviews went amazing but HR is not answering my emails now?

3 months ago I sent my resume to company X for the position of software engineer. (Company X is a very well known company that makes GPUs)
It seemed like the perfect position for me given that they were looking for someone with good C&#x2F;C++, Java, Perl skills (those are my strongest languages), knowledge of OO design patterns and machine learning was a bonus (I have talked about deep learning in many big ml groups).<p>I got contacted within a couple of days and went through 3 technical interviews, which went amazing! the interviewers pretty much welcomed me to the team and one of them even said: &quot;wow you really know your sh*t so I will stop asking now&quot;<p>The whole process was poorly organized and the interviewers all though they were the first person talking to me.<p>Nevertheless I felt pretty confident that I was getting the position (specially because the position was very Perl-centric and I happen to be very involved in the Perl community) but the HR lady who was helping me only contacted me to ask me if I would consider relocation (I said yes), then she said the HR manager was away, then she said the same thing and now she is not answering any of my emails.<p>I could just apply to another company, but I was really excited about that position and I have a lot admiration for the company.<p>A friend suggested me to email the head of HR, what does HN think I should do.
