# Ask HN: Isomorphic Hardware, what would apply?

I like the idea of isomorphic web apps: code that runs on both client and server.
What do you think about the concept of isomorphic hardware? Code that runs on different processors? Or, code in simulated environments vs. physical environments?<p>How would the isomorphic principle apply?
