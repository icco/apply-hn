# Ask HN: How to network in the startup community?

As a single founder&#x2F;developer of an organic-solution tech startup based in SoCal, I will be in San Jose from 1&#x2F;29 through 2&#x2F;3. My purpose is twofold - [1] I will be attending a large event in the area over the weekend to market&#x2F;promote my application, and [2] starting Sunday afternoon, I will have about three days to meet people and network in the valley.<p>Other than having applied for YC sessions W14 and W15 I have no contacts&#x2F;exposure in the community.<p>My question: as visitor&#x2F;newcomer to the valley, how can I meet people and make friends in the community during my upcoming trip? (meeting YC alums and&#x2F;or other founders would be great - I&#x27;d would like to improve my chances, should I apply again, among other things)
