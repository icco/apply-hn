# Ask HN: Why does Excel not support opening two files with the same name

I have been doing some manipulation on csv files and excel in my preferred choice to view the changes side by side in two excel windows. I apply each transformation and store the new files with the same name in a different folder. But excel does not allow me to open two files with the same name. Any ideas why something so trivial is not supported in a software as widely used as excel?
