# Apply HN: Favor â€“ PhoneGap / Wordpress for IoT Development

For those not familiar with IoT or device development, currently software is written to work with a specific type of hardware. If your device is using a specific accelerometer, your software will be written to work with that sensor. If you want to change the sensor your product is using, you need to update the software as well. This means software can&#x27;t
* be written easily as re-usable components
* isn&#x27;t easily testable
* no separation of concerns
* difficult to debug (is the issue in hardware or software)<p>This is the first issue Favor is addressing. With Favor, the hardware has a simple config file which describes the hardware and how to interact with it. You then write your business logic using Favor to accomplish whatever task needs to be done.<p>Favor is an open-source javascript library, hopefully simple to use and accessible to a wider base of developers who may have never developed hardware before.<p>You can check out the library at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;favor&#x2F;it or a demo hello-world video on youtube https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=bHKyFJ41amA<p>Keen to hear feedback, still in the very early stages of this.
