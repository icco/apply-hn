# Ask HN: Reputation systems that balance incumbency

Are there any internet based reputation systems where value&#x2F;rank&#x2F;weight is influenced by time?<p>For example articles at HN have a time weight due to chronological ordering but a time effect doesn&#x27;t apply to user weighting.<p>I&#x27;m asking about this for broader applications and not so much to determine if one way is better than the other.
