# Ask HN: Bayesian FTW

Reading this HN entry (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=9780677) has rekindled my interest in Bayesian logic.
My main introduction to the topic was through original Stanford AI MOOC.
I managed to get decent scores on all the Bayesian-related stuff, but I cannot say I really internalize the ideas.<p>What I am looking for is something that could help me making practical use of Bayes in my day-to-day life (professional and&#x2F;or personal).<p>So I am basically thinking of:<p>- books or articles detailing practical examples of how to apply Bayesian models to day-to-day choices (if these covered debug and testing activities it would be a big plus)
- an easy-to-use app (desktop or tablet&#x2F;smartphone) to build and play with Bayesian networks models.<p>Of course, if you have anything else to suggest along the same lines, please do.
