# Ask HN: When do you use objects in functional languages that also have objects?

I&#x27;ve been playing with Rust and now OCaml (in an attempt to understand Rust&#x27;s type system better) and something I find myself confused about is when to use objects in these multiparadigm languages compared to other functional languages where you only have functions and data structures to work with.<p>What type of reasoning do you apply or problems you find yourself solving when you decide to reach for objects instead?
