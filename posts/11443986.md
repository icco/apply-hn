# Ask HN: How to make a clickable link in the Ask HN description text?

In the apply hn thread(https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11440627), at the end of the description, there&#x27;s a clickable link to hn.algolia.com<p>Is there a way to for me to do the same? That&#x27;d be very convenient for an &quot;Apply HN&quot; submission.
