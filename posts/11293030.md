# Ask HN: Language-level package management with docker?

I&#x27;m a python user 6 months into using docker heavily and I&#x27;m experiencing impedance mismatch between pip &#x2F; wheel and docker&#x27;s cache.<p>Are there non-Dockerfile options for creating docker images that can optimize for requirements.txt?<p>Alternatively -- is there a way to apply layers out of order when they don&#x27;t touch the same files?
