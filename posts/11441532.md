# Apply HN: Sort, email lib and client that sort your emails by due date

Hi,<p>Sort is an email client that let you sort your emails by <i>due</i> date. The sender of an email can set that date using a specific syntax in the email body or you, the receiver can set&#x2F;change it as well once you get the email in your inbox (by forwarding it to yourself including the due date).
You can set an email to done (again, by forwarding it to yourself), and if you never do and it&#x27;s overdue, it will just keep rising in your inbox.<p>The idea would be to build maybe an open library first before a web-service. I&#x27;m not sure about the details but I would like someone to be able to use the Sort function without using the web-service inbox.<p>Some nice-to-have in the inbox would be to use colors to indicate how urgent the emails are.<p>Let me know if you want me to build that for you or if you have any question.
