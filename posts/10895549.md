# Ask HN: YC Fellowship, was it succesful? Will it be repeated?

It&#x27;s been a few months since YC Fellowship ended.<p>https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fellowship.ycombinator.com&#x2F;apply&#x2F;<p>I wanted to know if possible if it worked out for all parties involved (Y Combinator and the startups), and especially if Y Combinator is thinking about bringing it back in some form (maybe applying some lessons from the first batch) :) . Should we expect an announcement or lessons learned article any time soon?
