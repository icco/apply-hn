# Open letter to Microsoft: force Windows updates, don't force restart

To who microsoftie may concern.<p>Unexpected OS restart is one of the worst user experiences ever. And yet this is exactly what happens with Windows 10. The user loses unsaved documents, open browser tabs, and their prepared working environment.<p>This said I ask Microsoft to change a little the update procedure - download the updates, warn the user, but do not restart Windows. Just apply the update when the next restart occurs.<p>P.S. Sorry for using HN for publishing this letter, but this is my only place where my path crosses paths with some people from Microsoft.
