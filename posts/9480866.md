# Ask HN: What are interviewers looking for when they give you puzzles?

I&#x27;ve been doing some programming interviews lately, and they&#x27;ve all included &quot;typical&quot; programming challenges. A lot of them can be done through brute force, but it&#x27;s evident they are looking for the optimal solution ie. O(n).<p>I&#x27;m curious, do these companies want to see if you&#x27;ve already done a similar questions and are able to re-apply the solution? Or are they looking for you to produce a novel approach to the problem? If the latter, is it a typical expectation for a Software Engineer to be able to produce optimal solutions in short periods of time like that?<p>I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time studying these types of interview questions, but I continue to run into puzzles I&#x27;ve never seen. I&#x27;m concerned that they are looking for a degree of problem solving skills that I might not have.
