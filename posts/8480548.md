# Ask HN: How are you suppose to find a job?

How are you suppose to get a job if almost all job offers available online require like 10 to 5 years of experience. Should one still apply? Can you share your stories about finding your first job that you did not get straight out of college, that you found online, also share what was your hit ratio. Thanks.
