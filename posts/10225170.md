# Ask HN: How do I joint Y Combinator project?

Y Combinator has reputation of the best technical business incubator in the world and I have been using many services it helped to create myself (reddit, dropbox, parse and a plenty of others).<p>I have ~5 years experience programming for iOS and consider myself a decent developer.<p>The problem is: I don&#x27;t live in the US (but I do have a valid visitor visa).<p>Is it reasonable for me to seek people who are going to apply to YC and are in need of technical co-founder (or the ones who already got in but also looking for talent)? If yes, then where is the best place to start looking? jobs@hackernews seems to be focused on on-site positions, which implies need of work visa.
