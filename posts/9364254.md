# Ask HN: What would you do with a year off?

I am taking a gap year and have no obligations from June of this year (when I graduate high school) until at least August 2016. At this point, I have no idea how I&#x27;m going to fill all of this time. I&#x27;d love to hear your suggestions for how best to take advantage of this opportunity.<p>A couple of notes on my situation:<p>- I&#x27;ll be a minor (&lt; 18 y&#x2F;o) for this whole time period<p>- I have saved up a good amount of money from working this past year, so I&#x27;m okay on that front as long as I don&#x27;t go crazy<p>- I&#x27;ve been accepted into a top-10 Computer Science program for admission this fall that doesn&#x27;t let students defer for a whole year. I feel like I have a good shot at a top-5 or top-3 school if I apply again this fall (for admission next year). I don&#x27;t necessarily want to go to college yet, but I also don&#x27;t take being accepted there for granted.<p>- I&#x27;m located in the SF Bay Area<p>Cheers :)
