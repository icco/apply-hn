In the next few years, chatbots are going to become more intelligent and more widely used. Ecommerce in particular will feel more like an &quot;in-store interaction&quot; through chatbots. We&#x27;re starting with deals to help people find the product they&#x27;re looking for and purchase with a single click (or setup an alert for future purchases).<p>We&#x27;re a team of engineers in the Bay Area with experience building chatbot APIs and backend interactions for realtime chat applications.
