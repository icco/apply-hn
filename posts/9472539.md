# Ask HN: How do I get out of my mind now?

I&#x27;m almost 20.51, junior CS student from India. I have got a summer internship at a prominent company in US. It was a nice experience to apply and get selected as I found the company while doing a side-project in related field and loved it.<p>Life was going good but then some personal family wrong happened and it was easy enough to almost kill me.<p>This event broke me in both ways personally and financially. All in all, I was even unable to make it through my summer travel and visa process.<p>Sometimes I feel like I am done with it.
I feel scared that I had good opportunity but now I don&#x27;t have anything.<p>But at the same time I don&#x27;t want to see it ending this way. I have too much things in my active projects directory that I&#x27;m working on, some books that I&#x27;m reading and all.<p>Life seems tough now. Don&#x27;t what to do, where to go. No idea.<p><pre><code>  Artefact: Almost two months ago, I was playing with the Hacker News data and found one thing. Majority of people creates new accounts to ask such questions here. I think I should go with the minorities of that dataset.</code></pre>
