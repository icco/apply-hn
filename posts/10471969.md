# Ask HN: How much time do you spend on HN everyday ?

And how do you manage it?<p>This could apply more broadly to social media, and other online communities like ProductHunt.<p>A few months ago, I deactivated my Facebook account and unfollowed most of the people I used to follow on Twitter. I tried it as an experiment, and it worked out great. I dont have any urge to visit FB any longer, and I save ~10 hours every week which I used to spend browsing (mostly) useless stuff on FB (I keep track of the hours via Rescuetime).<p>When I look at my monthly HN usage, I can see that I visit ~8 links (on average, posts and comments) via HN everyday. However, thinking deeper on it, I hardly remember anything that I read via those links over the past month. I have been consistently spending ~1 hour everyday on HN for ~4 years now, and have been recently considering drastically reducing the time I spend here, as an experiment to see how much I would miss it. Its one of the more difficult things to do because I love the HN community, but I could probably spend that 1 hour everyday on more productive activities.
