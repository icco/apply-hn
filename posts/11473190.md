# Apply HN: Free domain (.com)

A virtual cup of coffee in the form of a 1 year new domain (.com) registration (with GoDaddy account&#x2F;200+ Karma). In exchange, check out my demo link and post a comment&#x2F;feedback, and I will register any new .com of your choice and include you in the Beta. This is to highlight domain gifting is a &quot;problem&quot;. Gift cards&#x2F;promo codes are not available directly from the sellers. If nothing else, I will make it far easier to buy someone a domain name as a gift.<p>Demo&#x2F;prototype:  tomorrowbook.com&#x2F;trending<p>What is tomorrowbook?<p>Weebly with a social media enabled text message web builder (get notifications when your favorite domains post new content to their website and upvote content distributed across the network of member domains).<p>Me:  A practicing lawyer...don&#x27;t hold it against me.  Currently I provide services similar to Stripe Atlas, cherry pick criminal defense cases and some IP work.  I have engaged in diverse side ventures including, V-Blood, a vampire themed energy drink, distributed through Hot Topic and more recently a liquidation event with tech startup I co-founded in the legal space.  Current project raise the funds to hire Gigster to develop the tomorrowbook Beta.
