# Ask HN: Does RAM speed matter for programming?

It is a well accepted fact that lots of RAM does improve performance.  But does RAM speed matter in computation intensive operations?  Is there a difference between 1600MHz RAM and a 2400MHz RAM in performance, everything else being equal? If so, how much?<p>I have googled around and came across a few links and this excellent review http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.anandtech.com&#x2F;show&#x2F;6372&#x2F;memory-performance-16gb-ddr31333-to-ddr32400-on-ivy-bridge-igp-with-gskill .  But all of these seem to be in the context of gaming? Does it apply to programming too?
