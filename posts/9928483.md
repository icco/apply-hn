# Ask HN: When should I apply for a job in the US?

Hi everybody!
I recently graduated my MSc in Italy and the US (double degree program). A couple months ago I applied at some interesting middle-sized US companies and I have been told to reapply after some months, as the h1b cap had been reached already. So I got a job in Germany, which is cool, but I&#x27;d really like to go back to the US and work for some of the most interesting companies right now. So, when would be the best time to apply in order to a)maximize my chances of getting an offer, b)maximize my chances of getting an h1b?
