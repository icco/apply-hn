# Apply HN: Givdo â€“ gaming app that raises money for nonprofits

Website: www.givdo.com<p>Building a trivia app that allows users to play corporate-sponsored trivia games, allowing them to win points that translate into real monetary donations for nonprofits.<p>The user chooses which nonprofit to play for before playing the games and can change it any time they&#x27;d like. Nonprofits go through an approval process to make sure they&#x27;re up to standards.<p>Currently looking for beta users (if interested, you can sign up on the front page of our website). Thoughts?
