# Ask HN: Has anyone updated an Android app from free to having in-app purchases?

I have a popular app and would like to enable some useful premium features using in-app purchases.<p>However, I believe this will require all users to accept new permissions when they update, and there isn&#x27;t an option to explain what the in-app purchases apply to.<p>Has anyone been through this process? What was the effect on your downloads and updates?<p>Thanks!
