# Apply HN: Wiredhere|Connecting you to Fitness partners and trainers near you

Website: www.wiredhere.com<p>What we do: 
Wiredhere is a mobile app that allows users to find partners or trainers in sports and fitness. Tennis, gym, and even basketball partners will be easily accessible within the app; as well as knowing who the best trainers are due to our rating system.<p>How: 
Users simply choose their facility or university they attend, the activities they&#x27;re interested in, and that&#x27;s it. The user will than get a push notification through their phone soon as someone creates an activity and is looking for a partner. 
We are partnering with our University rec center as well as 2 other local gyms near us to have their trainers use our platform. All users will be able to rate the trainers similar to how ratemyprofessor.com operates.<p>About us: 
We&#x27;re a group of 4 entrepreneurs who has known each other collectively for over 20 years. We are two programmers experienced in a number of languages, a sysadmin, and a data scientist. We also have worked together in the past with startups, so we actually get along (unless there&#x27;s a debate on who gets the last portion of tea).<p>Feel free to ask us ANYTHING. We love criticism.
