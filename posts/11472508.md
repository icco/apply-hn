# Apply HN: Cubeit- Making Conversations More Contextual

Cubeit is a place to have conversation around content (like hackernews but in the mobile world). We are trying to solve the problem of context getting lost in current communication apps like WhatsApp.<p>How are we doing it ?<p>1. When links are shared in Cubeit, we convert it into a smart card which has only the useful information from that link along with actionable CTAâ€™s. So if you put something from the Product Hunt app in a Cube shared with your friends, even if they don&#x27;t have the Product Hunt client app installed on their phone, a Product Hunt smart card will give enough context about the shared content in Cubeit about it (photos and videos are automatically extracted for example)<p>2. Our chat bar is new the search bar. You can now search through multiple apps for for videos, gifs, restaurants and other sources that we support without going out of Cubeit or having any of these apps installed on your phone and share it with your friends directly from the chat bar.
