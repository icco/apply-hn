# Apply HN: Lenzy â€“ affordable photographers guaranteed to suit you, booked in 50s

With Lenzy you can choose the perfect photographer for your needs, get a guaranteed price and book&#x2F;pay within 50 seconds. Bookings will either take place via our web-app or, more commonly, our JS plugin embedded in third party websites and apps where users might need the services of a photographer (e.g. a job platform, shopify, airbnb, ebay etc). Instead of choosing a photographer based on their profile, our photo recommendation engine lets you choose the right photographer for your needs based on samples from their portfolios in a tinder-style interface.<p>As avid photographers ourselves, we know that this is the optimal way of finding the right photographer for your project, due to it being a much more subjective, individual perspective than other on demand services such as cleaning, transport etc, where safety and peer-approval are paramount (the photographer who my friend thought did a great job at her wedding, for example, is probably not the right person for my e-commerce product photos). Interestingly, thanks to the general increase of interest in photography and the improvement in photography hard- &amp; software, 90% of the &#x27;best&#x27; photographers out there are actually amateurs, art-students and other hobby-photographers who &#x27;occasionally do shoots for friends&#x27;. By harnessing this eager supply, matching efficiently and increasing the demand by making awesome photos available to everybody at a price they can afford, we can offer a better quality experience than &#x27;professional photographers&#x27; at less than half of the price.<p>We are a team of 3, who have worked together successfully on projects before...<p>- 1 designer &amp; professional photographer
- 1 (mainly front-end) dev&#x2F;amateur photographer&#x2F;sales guy
- 1 back-end dev (not great at taking photos, but has seen thousands in his lifetime)<p>We have a working beta and partnerships with third party sites which are profitable.<p>We would love to field your questions&#x2F;feedback :)
