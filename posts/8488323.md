# Ask HN: Is there any psychology behind consistently lightening color choices?

I saw some discussions earlier today surrounding http:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatuicolors.com&#x2F; and http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.flatuicolorpicker.com&#x2F;. This got me thinking about my color choices and I wanted to get some opinions.<p>I use several of the colors listed on Flat UI: alizarin, nephritis, and sun flower. I often need a lighter&#x2F;darker variant of the colors. To do this, I apply LESS&#x27; &quot;lighten&quot; and &quot;darken.&quot; My colors end up looking like:<p><pre><code>    @baseBlue: rgb(78,166,234);
    @lightBaseBlue: lighten(@baseBlue, 30%);
    @darkBaseBlue: darken(@baseBlue, 10%);

    &#x2F;&#x2F;  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatuicolors.com&#x2F;
    @nephritis: rgb(39,174,96);
    @lightNephritis: lighten(@nephritis, 30%);
    @alizarin: rgb(231,76,60);
    @lightAlizarin: lighten(@alizarin, 30%);
    @darkAlizarin: darken(@alizarin, 10%);
    @sunFlower: rgb(241, 196, 15);
</code></pre>
Is there any psychological benefit associated with lightening&#x2F;darkening each color by consistent percentages? Sometimes I feel like a color looks &#x27;off&#x27; when lightened. For instance, lightNephritis feels like it has a bit too much blue in it, but I&#x27;m happy with nephritis. However, I also feel weird about just choosing a new &#x27;lightGreen&#x27; color instead of lightening my base color.<p>Thoughts?
