# Ask HN: How important is having experience in specific technologies?

During my job search I&#x27;m finding plenty of companies that I&#x27;d love to work for, but the skills they are looking for specifically are not ones I have.<p>For example, I have personal project experience in PHP with the Laravel framework and AngularJS on the front-end. But a job I&#x27;m looking at is asking for EmberJS front-end with Ruby on Rails back-end experience.<p>Is it worth my time to apply for this position? Or should I acquire experience in new technologies?
