# Apply HN Idea Essentials

www.ideaessentials.com<p>So many of us have ideas but don&#x27;t know where to start. There are books, methodologies, courses, and webpages full of information, but what if we just want to get started right away? And what if we don&#x27;t want to lose tons of money doing it? Well, there&#x27;s another option called Idea Essentials.<p>Idea Essentials is an online tool that asks questions about your idea and then creates a customized, step by step roadmap to take any idea from concept to market including how to build a business around the idea, scale up, and prepare it for funding. Everything is done with complete privacy and using principles from some of the best, most proven idea development methodologies in the world (lean startup, Human Centered Design, Stage Gate, etc.) Pertinent resources are provided with each step, and useful reports such as executive summaries, scope of work, etc. are unlocked and can be exported.<p>An MVP is available for your use right now at www.ideaessentials.com. Check it out. It represents the first iteration of something that will revolutionize the way the world develops ideas.<p>I welcome any questions or suggestions and hope that Idea Essentials will be considered for the Y Combinator program.<p>Thanks!
