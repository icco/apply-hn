# Apply HN: Magako, AI for Math Tutoring

Magako is an AI based on symbolic mathematics to help teenagers in math. Think of something like Mathematica used to correct math exercises and show hints when a student is stuck. The UI allows to solve exercises interactively as shown in this video: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;honHcFguXsQ<p>I know there are many apps or websites offering some kind of online math exercises, but I believe the AI makes Magako unique.<p>I have built a prototype version for the web ( http:&#x2F;&#x2F;magako.com ) and for Android ( https:&#x2F;&#x2F;play.google.com&#x2F;store&#x2F;apps&#x2F;details?id=org.test.magako ), the latter having a bit more math content.
