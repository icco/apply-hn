# Tell HN: The Creepiness Factor â€“ Why I Won't Apply for Analytics Jobs

I don&#x27;t want to be tracked.  It is for that reason that I blackhole analytics servers in my hosts file:<p><pre><code>   127.0.0.1 www.google-analytics.com
   127.0.0.1 www.hosted-pixel.com
</code></pre>
Now I am very public on the Internet.  What I object to is anyone at all being tracked.  If you visit a website that sells strawberry jam, why should the prioprietors of that site even be permitted to know you were, say, a gay Muslim male?<p>On Thursday I went to a job fair in Portland, however I did not approach all of the booths.  One that I did not was Rentrak, because it promised a product that identifies &quot;how they vote&quot;.  Neither did I approach Webtrends because they &quot;invented analytics&quot;.
