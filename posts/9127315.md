# Ask HN: Where do I apply for internship?

Hello HN,<p>I&#x27;m from India. Last summers I had done open source contribution as a GSoC student. This summer break I would like to intern at an organization to get the onboard experience. 
I request community members to guide me on where to apply!
I have my work experience details on HN profile. 
Thanks :)
