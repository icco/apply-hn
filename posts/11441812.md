# Apply HN: A clustering engine that identifies people congregation areas

Here at Wisebud we&#x27;re building a SaaS clustering engine that identifies people congregation areas and helps analyze how masses behave in real-time. Think Apache Storm but context aware and with support for complex computations. It is also fully decentralized and brokerless. The engine can ingest spatio-temporal data from mobile networks, mobile apps and IoT.
The clusters are contextualized to find user behavior patterns – what and when are people doing at any given location. Companies analyze their own user base, let it be app users, mobile network subscribers or IoT users. There will also be a free global view of the population for researchers, users, governments or anyone else who’s interested.
