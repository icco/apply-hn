# Ask HN: How to become an effective Citizen scientist

I have my own successful startup but I often think about what I would like to do when I retire or have more free time besides potentially starting other companies.<p>I really enjoy cosmology, astronomy and physics but my skills are unfortunately programming related (I would say computer science but that would be an abuse of the word science).<p>Everyday in the morning I read wikipedia articles on advance math and science. I probably only understand 10% but I trudge onward in hope that I some day will be better prepared and more likely accepted to be given the chance to help (in the previously mentioned disciplines).<p>But I&#x27;m wondering if maybe I should actually get involved earlier. I see lots of opportunities but some of them are close to mechanical turk &#x2F; rote (like continuously monitoring road kill). I was hoping to apply some creative programming skills instead.<p>Are there HN users that are Citizen scientist that were or are programmers? If so... any tips?
