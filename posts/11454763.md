Problem: We want people to be able to have conversations in a way that is independent of location and time. We strongly believe that when people actually talk, barriers and stereotypes go away. We want to leverage the power of the internet to achieve that.<p>Our Solution: Bleepmic. With 30s audio notes (which we believe is the limit of keeping people focused on what you are saying), people are able to have conversations in a town hall like manner while not being limited by proximity or time. You can jump into a conversation started by someone in Wyoming, for example, and share your two cents and then checkin in an hour, hear what other people said and jump right back in with your thoughts.<p>Check us out on the App Store!
