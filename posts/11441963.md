# Apply HN: Dribblr â€“ app to organize pickup sports

Dribblr will allow players to create games, invite FB friends and saved groups of friends, view RSVPs,  and split costs through RSVPs. Invites can be sent to contacts regardless of if they have Dribblr or not.
Players looking for a game can search a map view or a chronological view with the sports they like, get invited to games, or set up subscription alerts.<p>The novel part of the app is the SUBSCRIPTION PREFERENCES: Knowing when a player is free, his preferred sports, competitive level, and geographical range will notify him of the best games for him being created by friends and other users.<p>I hope to eventually build an AI to take everyone&#x27;s preferences and create perfect games for them to save everyone even more time and frustration.<p>Demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;6JipGzUHMJE
