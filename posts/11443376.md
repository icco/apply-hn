# Apply HN: Fiction as a Service

Hello HN, with all the excitement of Apply HN this morning I couldn&#x27;t help myself. I had to throw an idea out there.<p>I really like reading Science Fiction and Fantasy novels, but I would like to explore an alternate method for discovering new authors and funding their writing.<p>I&#x27;m a game developer, and I would like to apply some of the lessons we have learnt in the games industry in the last 10 years or so.<p>I think books should be free up front, and readers who are really enjoying a book should be invited to contribute to development of more books by asking them to buy premium content.<p>This lowers the barrier to entry, and because there is no fixed price for a book, fans can spend as much or as little as they like delving into the world that the author has created.<p>Premium content for a book is probably special chapters, side stories, back stories, more detail, more to read; but it might also include getting involved in the writing, naming characters and helping determine the outcome of events. Readers might even be interested in chatting with their favorite author.<p>I want to build a platform that authors can use publish their own books, and help them structure and sell their content in this innovative way.<p>Think Steam for Science Fiction and Fantasy, but with a focus on making great free fiction easy to find, and exciting premium content easy to buy.
