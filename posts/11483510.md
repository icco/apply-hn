# Apply HN: Remember â€“ Intelligently search all of your files from one place.

Hello HN!<p>Remember is an intelligent personal search engine that lets you find every moment of your digital life.<p>We connect to your computer, phone, wearables and the services you use (Facebook, Twitter, mobile apps, etc.) and make all of your data searchable from one place. Going a step further, we run machine learning algorithms on all of your files to understand context so you can search using natural language.<p>We lose so much time looking for our files; be it notes, messages, photos, videos, audio recordings.<p>&quot;Let me show you a video I sent Jack it&#x27;s hilarious!&quot; <i>Stares at phone for 15 minutes looking for it</i><p>&quot;I have a breakthrough idea about mitosis, let me write it down.&quot; <i>Never gets back to that note again</i><p>This must end. We want to help maximise human potential, and we think this as close as we can get to having perfect memory with today&#x27;s technology.<p>Founders:<p>Mert Erdir - Experience Design: BA Product Design in Milan, Italy.
