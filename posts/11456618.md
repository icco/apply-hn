# Apply HN: Synchrony â€“ A peer-to-peer hyperdocument editor

<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Psybernetics&#x2F;Synchrony" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;Psybernetics&#x2F;Synchrony</a><p>This is a caching proxy that lets people get on the same page and edit together.<p>It features a distributed friends list and easily configurable overlay networks so people can create private filesharing networks just by picking a name.<p>Should also feature WebRTC teleconferencing as part of the encrypted chat RPC.<p>It decentralises HTTP &#x2F;IN PLACE&#x2F; with no substituting existing URLs for content hashes. It should be able to utilise fseek to retrieve hypermedia objects at specific
start bytes after dividing the reported file size to effectively torrent 
CC-BY YouTube videos or other sizeable objects from anyone else who&#x27;s already retrieved the object and decided they&#x27;re OK with serving the data.<p>Just needs porting to Golang and lots of testing.<p>The revenue model I have in mind is similar to the mainline Bittorrent client with an optional ad in the installer.
