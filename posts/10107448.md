# Ask HN: What do developers earn on toptal.com?

This site seems to be pitching itself as the replacement for odesk and elance- where you work with the &quot;top %3 of developers&quot; (who knows how they can make that claim) and they pay you well, because you&#x27;re the &quot;top %3&quot;.<p>Has anyone gone thru the process?<p>The fundamental issue of outsourcing is usually trading quality for low price... given their language towards the developers on the apply page, it seems like this is a sweatshop that doesn&#x27;t pay well.<p>But my mind is open.  Is it really worth doing? For someone who isn&#x27;t junior?<p>(EG: I have several patents, and several decades of experience.)
