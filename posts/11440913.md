The three tier system requires that all wholesale alcohol in this country be ordered from a liquor distributor. These distributors are primarily sales and logistics agents and aren&#x27;t technology driven.<p>We are looking to create enterprise software that allows liquor distributors to start accepting orders online via the web and mobile. This frees up sales reps to do high level sales activities and lets distributors save money by being able to service more accounts.<p>P.S. We are looking for a rails developer to hire if anyone is looking for some hourly work.
