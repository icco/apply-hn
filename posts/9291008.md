# Ask HN: Is it realistic to apply late to YC?

We were quite unsure about applying, as our product was somewhat too vague. After crawling around it, we&#x27;ve finally got something interesting.<p>Nonetheless, we&#x27;ve realized YC has become more competitive and focused on life&#x2F;physical sciences. As young international founders building a SaaS product, we&#x27;ve been wondering if it&#x27;s even worth the time to apply.<p>I&#x27;d understand the &quot;why not?&quot; argument, but timing for a decent application is fairly considerable for us.
