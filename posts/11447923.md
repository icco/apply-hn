# Apply HN: Digital Teleportation = SocialAR/VR

Talking with a previously unknown person is common in the real world but is quite hard to do online. Thanks to VR that mimics the real world it should be possible now to meet people on the internet...<p>Imagine a never ending street fair welcoming people from everywhere...<p>First we need to solve two problems:<p>- break the limit &quot;no more than ~100 can attend an event in VR&quot;<p>- build a virtual world with relevant content<p>DiveReal networking technology: a distributed system, a 3-layered overlay tested with 20k simulated avatars together in one place.
Long story short: add more servers to accommodate more users in your room.
btw: there is only one &quot;room&quot;, planet-sized.<p>DiveReal virtual world: we use streetview, we use the whole planet, you can send your avatar anywhere on earth. With AR devices you&#x27;ll see the avatars coming to your living-room (see &quot;holoportation&quot; from MS Research)<p>Go at http:&#x2F;&#x2F;divereal.com and try the software for Oculus Rift DK2 (0.7)<p>Also I am working on a new release due in few weeks, to betatest the dev version send me an email at contact@divereal.com   
Builds available for: GearVR, Oculus Rift and desktops (Windows, OS X, Ubuntu)<p>This is an application for YC fellowship, if you like the project and want to help, upvote and discuss, see: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11440627<p>Questions, comments, ... your valuable feedback is very welcome
