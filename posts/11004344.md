# Ask HN: Any advice for an older engineer stuck in his career?

I am in my mid thirties. I earn decently, but it has been years since I learned anything new or even enjoyed my work. I am not half as good as the HN crowd, but I can build things and be quite useful to a team. I made the stupid move to go from Java (desktop apps) to PHP and am now stuck maintaining a poorly written legacy (15 year old) app and under a lot of pressure to deliver (fixing performance, clean up code etc) and I am not living up to it. Most importantly, I am just not enjoying it.<p>What can I do to get out of this rut? I absolutely do not want to work on legacy codebases anymore (can&#x27;t leave the job until July for various reasons) and I&#x27;d also like to get out of PHP if possible (go back to Java or learn something new).<p>I am afraid to apply for jobs that require experience I don&#x27;t have. I&#x27;d totally love to work in graph databases for example (have played with it a bit before), or data analysis, data viz etc.<p>Any advice?
