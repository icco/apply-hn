# Apply HN: Native Web Browser

Native apps provide better UX and performance than the web, we all agree on that now. However, I don&#x27;t see myself installing every other app, as most times, I would use them just once in 6 months. With limited space on mobiles, there are millions like me who have to compromise with the mobile web. Wouldn&#x27;t it be nice to have a browser which renders native components resulting in an awesome user experience with great performance?<p>Well, the solution is already out there! Its called React Native, a framework by Facebook which helps you create native apps using JavaScript. But instead of making apps which one installs, our goal is to make them streamable and build a browser which interprets the React Native code and renders it using native components just like Chrome does HTML. React Native already does this but isn&#x27;t optimised for it. Let&#x27;s built it and make the web great again!<p>P.S. - The project is going to be open-source and there are no revenue models as of now. I&#x27;m @troysk704 on twitter and happy to answer questions.
