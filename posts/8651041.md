# Ask HN: Start a web development company or take job as a web developer

Hi!
I have been doing web development and design since last 5 years but have never been able to work full time because of my other bindings( University&#x2F; Dad&#x27;s business). During these times, I have been always developing, either for my own startup ideas or as a freelancer taking up small website projects.<p>Now, I am ready to work full time as a web developer and designer. So, what is a better option? To look for employment or to start my own web agency? What did you choose when you had the same dilemma?<p>Also, since I have been entrepreneur mostly, I have been doing do all these :  http:&#x2F;&#x2F;media-cache-ec0.pinimg.com&#x2F;736x&#x2F;06&#x2F;c1&#x2F;61&#x2F;06c161037b046318fb1108db11e4d9ba.jpg
So, if I choose to take employment, I am not very sure what role to apply for to make the best of my abilities and be most useful to the employer.<p>Thanks.  :)
