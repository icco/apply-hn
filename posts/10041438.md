# Ask HN: Premature optimization â€“ when to use?

I know the old adage, but I think I have a use case where it is false, so I want to see what HN has to say about it.<p>Fist of all, this is a private project, something I am working on with me as the only user. So the whole market fit issue shouldn&#x27;t be relevant*.<p>So I am working on a webscraping project, mainly through trying to apply what I have leared through the learn python the hardway course. So far so good, everything is working well. But when I deployed my first spider, it took an hour, and returned ~20 million lines for one year (I want to get data going back at least 5 years).<p>So its working the way I want, but I am thinking, should I start looking at my code and see if there are ways I can speed it up?<p>Either way, it&#x27;s not a problem, I have spare computers I can set to run the program for hours on end.<p>But should I waste electricity running a hack, or should I try to start optimizing now?
