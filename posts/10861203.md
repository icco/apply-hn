# Ask HN: Consultant with 6 months at big firm. Is it too soon to apply for startup?

I&#x27;m a new grad with a degree in finance, but I love programming and tackling challenging, weird and new problems. I&#x27;m about a half-year into working for a big consulting firm, but I can already tell that it&#x27;s not going to work long-term - I don&#x27;t like super-structured hours, relatively limited freedoms and a big hierarchy.<p>When is too early to start applying for new jobs? How do I go about interviewing if I&#x27;m not sure that the startup I&#x27;m interviewing at is right for me and I don&#x27;t want to leave my current job if it&#x27;s not? What&#x27;s your advice?
