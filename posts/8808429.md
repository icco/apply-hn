# Ask HN: Which online CS course to take if I want a job tomorrow?

Background: I taught myself iOS app development and have been doing so for about 3 years. I have enough income&#x2F;savings to survive for a while, so there&#x27;s no rush, but I&#x27;ve been considering finding a job, perhaps at a startup or an app dev shop. My apps are mostly kids games&#x2F;entertainment, nothing super complicated.<p>I took a couple courses, CS1 and Intro to C&#x2F;Unix, at a local university, got 4.0 GPA each (bell curved up).<p>I can program, but I lack most of the formal CS education that normal engineers have. If I wanted to apply for a job after 1 month, what online CS course would be most beneficial for me (things I would actually need&#x2F;use day to day or in an interview to show competency)?<p>Algorithms? Databases? Data Structures? Entry level courses of course. Any input appreciated. Thanks
