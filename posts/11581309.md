# Apply HN: Knowledge Maps â€“ Together, find the best resources to solve a problem

http:&#x2F;&#x2F;knowledgemaps.org<p>Whenever we do a google search to learn something, we are presented with a list of links which are likely to solve our problem. But only after going through multiple links and trying different search queries do we find those few links that actually prove useful.<p>This process is repeated by people all over the world who are trying to solve the same problem. (e.g. How to get initial traction for your startup).<p>So, we started a Wikipedia like project where people come together to figure out the 10 best links that solve a problem. It is called Knowledge Maps.<p>If you have a problem you can go to Knowledge Maps to see how people around the world are solving the same problem and the links that they are using. If your problem is unique, you can ask the community. The community as a whole will suggest you links and resources.<p>This way a knowledge map becomes a step by step road-map to solve any problem.
