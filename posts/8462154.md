# Ask HN: Any startups here that moved off of BaaS (ex. Parse, Kinvey, Kii)? Why?

If you were part of a startup that was initially built on a Backend-as-a-Service, but later moved off-- why did you move off? What exactly prompted the decision? Was it cost, inflexibility, something else?<p>I would <i>love</i> to talk to you about this (no more than 15 min) to find out why-- in exchange, you will get a box of your favorite snacks or chocolate and a young startup&#x27;s undying gratitude. (If you know someone from a startup that moved off BaaS, please connect me; same snacks&#x2F;choco&#x2F;gratitude apply.)<p>Please comment below or email falling.hill@gmail.com<p>Context: I&#x27;m cofounder of a startup that is adding a new spin on BaaS, and we want to make sure our new spin adds enough value.
