# Apply HN: Hairme â€“ Programmable Haircuts for Men

Problem: I hate haircuts, more so coz 1. I&#x27;m lazy when it comes to doing repetitive things, 2. Hate the time spent in commute, waiting and planning, 3. I have to get it done every month or my mom gets very angry at me, 4. And I hate Great Clips and their stylists. So I&#x27;ll be solving my own problem here. And I know all of my male buddies hate this routine too, yet shell $100 to get Tom Cruise&#x27;s cut.<p>Solution: A programmable helmet, that can be adjusted to fit your head. A video panel with a camera, which takes your picture, lets you choose a hairstyle that will suit your facial profile. You sit, it cuts, and you are done. All in your bathroom, while you are sitting on the toilet maybe. (If you are a multi-tasker like me, sometimes..)<p>Bonus: Get cash back by &quot;recycling&quot; your hair.<p>Progress: Working on initial helmet design and programming architecture. Shooting to have the MVP&#x2F;Beta ready by end of July&#x2F;Aug (hopefully), with one style - Crew Cut. I&#x27;ll be the guinea pig for the first few cuts.<p>Future: Will expand to Women Haircuts&#x2F;styles.<p>Look forward to your feedback. Thanks so much!
