# Ask HN: Why do I have to struggle with everything?

I am 29.5 yrs old and was born in poor family. First it was education , paying college fees. I had to work since 16 part-time for paying fees. Then landed a job. Worst professional environment one could imagine. 
Changed job last year. After marathon search ,apply, reject,re-apply landed a opportunity after 3 months. 
In personal life also I am yet to find girlfriend. Never had one. 
When I look at my colleagues, friends I feel like many of them have it quite easy. College, job, personal life but its me who has to try ( or repeat process 1000 times) for simple things.  
Why this is so?  Its just makes me frustrated.
