# Ask HN: How do you apply Agile principles to software with long lifecycle?

I work for a company that produces software with long lifecycle - our customers are big companies that can not&#x2F;dare not install updates overnight, instead they install update after extensive testing  every 6-12 months. How do I apply agile principles to the development if I can not bring something of a value to the customer every sprint? Is agile even suitable for long lifecycle software?
