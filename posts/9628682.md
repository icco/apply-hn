# Ask HN: I Have Cancer. What Should I Do?

I just left my engineering job at a medium-large employer to join an 18-person startup. I am set to start the new gig late next week.<p>I found a marble-sized lump under my armpit a few days ago.  I quickly got it checked out, and the preliminary report just came back that it&#x27;s probably cancerous.<p>What the hell should I do?<p>I&#x27;m 25, and otherwise healthy, so was not expecting this.<p>I really care about this new team and was excited to work with them.  I feel horrible about joining a young business as an albatross instead of an asset.<p>I left my old job on good terms but have no idea how they could justify re-hiring an employee who left and may not be productive &#x2F; able to work.<p>If I start at my new job I&#x27;m afraid I will endanger the business and raise everybody&#x27;s premiums.  I think they have a fairly generic group plan.<p>If I don&#x27;t start my new job, how will I support myself?<p>My fianc√© also works at a small startup so if I joined her insurance the same issues would apply.<p>I think I can still purchase my old insurance through Cobra, but I don&#x27;t know how long that will last.<p>Thanks.
