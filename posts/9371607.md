# Ask HN: When generating ideas â€“ what are the key tests you apply first?

I have a google doc which I keep all the hundreds of truly random ideas I get for startups etc. I&#x27;m trying to develop a quick method with as few points as possible to flesh out the idea and test for viability ie:<p>1. Revenue Model - how will it generate income
2. User base - who will use it, and Why?
3. Growth - how quickly will this grow?
4. Implementation - What do I need to do to implement this idea?<p>I&#x27;m looking for a discussion around what I should add (or remove) from the list.
