# Ask HN: Is it feasible to ask not to talk while coding during interview?

I cannot code and talk at the same time. Generally speaking, I cannot talk and write at the same time. I can write a few short sentences down, but I can&#x27;t write a clear and concise paragraph while talking, either in my native language or in English. My code will be a mess while I am talking. I don&#x27;t know why.<p>I regard myself as a good engineer. In each job I have, I become one of the de facto lead engineers. I have built high performant systems that support dozens of millions of unique users daily. But I failed miserably during tech interviews, especially when I was asked to code during phone calls.<p>So is it feasible that I ask not to have code interview via phone call? Is it feasible in onsite interview that I ask not to talk while I am thinking and coding. I am fully aware of the norm that I should talk aloud of my thought process. That is the reason I ask here.<p>P.S. It is also the reason I can&#x27;t do pair programming. If an engineering team requires pair programming, I will not apply since I know I am unqualified.
