# Tell HN: Why I Don't Apply to Jobs That Request Salary History

The very first real resume I ever wrote had my pay at each position I&#x27;d held.  The Caltech Student Employment Office advised me to omit my pay history as it would make it unlikely I would ever get paid much more than I previously had.<p>Just now I found a craigslist post for what I felt would be a really good job for me.  I contemplated responding without my salary history, then decided not to respond at all, as I feel that so much as to request a salary history likely indicates that the company does not have ethical employment practices.
