# Ask HN: What sort of software stack to live-streaming apps like Meerkat use?

This could apply to things like Meerkat or the other Life On Air apps. I&#x27;m curious as to if they use traditional streaming technologies or if they use something more new, like WebRTC (I&#x27;m not sure if WebRTC is scalable for something like this, but whatever)
