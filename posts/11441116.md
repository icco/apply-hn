We are building Educative.io to let anyone create Interactive and Visual courses for CS&#x2F;Tech. Creating and publishing courses is free for authors and our WYSIWIG editor enables quick creation of interactive and visual content. Learners will buy courses through our marketplace and they will be able to learn better using visualizations and can do interactive exercises to quickly learn new concepts.<p>We are now working on creating full-fledge interactive environments that will let authors create courses on Data Science, Big Data, AI etc. where all the execution happens on our servers and learners can interact with their sand-boxed environments.<p>And we just released our iOS app today (will be in app store in a few hours).<p>Some examples are<p>Coderust 2.0: Faster Coding Interview Preparation using Visualizations - https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.educative.io&#x2F;collection&#x2F;5642554087309312&#x2F;5679846214598656<p>Learn ReactJS in Browser (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.educative.io&#x2F;collection&#x2F;5638830484881408&#x2F;70001)
