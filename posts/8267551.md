# Ask HN: Looking for a developer?

I hear here and there people saying: &quot;There are no good developers to hire anymore.&quot;\nWell, I am currently looking for a job, and what I have concluded from my little research is that the way companies hire people makes me feel like nobody actually wants me. \nI have to fill gazillions of fields, I have to go through various kinds of pre-interview processes, like this last one - its an automatic video interviewing system, that records my answers using some pre-recorded videos as questions. Cool system, technically, but I will have to spend hours on this thing. Ideally I would have to send a link to my resume or a pdf (where my name, email, and all the others are), and company would figure out on their own whether they want me or not. If they are interested, we can arrange video meetings or meet in person to see if I am not some weirdo. Like I sent my cv to twitter and they sent me that I am no fit for the position, fair enough. :) I still had to fill forms and write a cover letter. Obviously if I apply for the job, I am interested in the subject and interested in the company and willing to learn if anything beyond my knowledge appears. No need for cover letters. These days a lot of companies offers good salary, health coverage, gym and other benefits, so basically the company should &quot;sell&quot; it self to me - show why I should choose them, not the other way around.<p>Do you feel the same?
