# Apply HN: ATM â€“ Making ads interesting and worth watching

Problems: Three major problems with commercial ads: 
1) Most of the ads are ignored or just skipped
2) A tv channel or a broadcasting network gets to keep billions of dollars while consumers who are actually watching ads are left with nothing
3) Companies are spending those billions without consumers actually watching or retaining their ad.<p>Idea: ATM (Ad Triva Money) could solve all those three problems by creating trivia on commercial ads and passing on 80% of advertising revenue to consumers who answer trivia correctly. This makes watching ads interesting and fun, increases retention and provides financial benefit to the end user.<p>I know it might sound crazy but I would like to know your honest feedback regarding the idea. Do you think building such an app is even possible as most of the mobile advertising is now automated and generated through code?<p>Note: I am a solo founder with no technical skills (a major drawback) and have been trying to find a technical co-founder without any luck. Do you think it&#x27;s better if I learn coding myself?<p>Any little feedback is greatly appreciated! Thanks a lot for your time!
