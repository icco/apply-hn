# Ask HN: How Relevant Is a Technical Degree/Exp to Get a Job as a Software Engg?

I did my Bachelors Degree in Arts. I got interested in Computer Science&#x2F;Programming and enrolled myself in a Object Oriented Certification program at a local community college. In this program I learned VB, C&#x2F;C++, Java, Android Development, Javascript &amp; HTML&#x2F;CSS. I also picked up PHP &amp; SQL for a personal project. After completing my OO Certification I got this job where I am working on Wordpress (mostly) and sometimes VB&#x2F;HTML&#x2F;CSS. I am in this job since March of this year but I don&#x27;t think I am learning anything. I feel as if I am wasting my time and my knowledge. I wanted to work in Java as I really liked it during my academic program at the community college. Also I would like to work on Programming projects but wherever I apply either they are asking for 2-3 years of relevant experience or a Masters&#x2F;Bachelors in Computer Science.
Do I had to have a degree for sure if I would like to get a job as a software engineer&#x2F;programmer? I am thinking of getting a Masters in Computer science, but again it will be an investment of both time &amp; money. I guess I have the basic platform to start as a programmer.<p>Please suggest what should I do ?
