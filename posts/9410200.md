# Ask HN: References of open source “teaching” apps

I find the easiest way to learn a new language&#x2F;platform is to get an example app running and mess around for a while - but it&#x27;s often hard to find the right code for this. Is there a good reference of good example code bases?<p>For example, right now I&#x27;m learning Swift and looking for example apps. There are a bunch on Github, but I&#x27;m not sure which are best for learning. I could apply some heuristics like best commented &#x2F; most watched, but seems like there should be a better way.<p>How do you all find example code bases to play with? If this is a problem for others, I&#x27;d be willing to put together a reference website for this - would anyone want to work on this?
