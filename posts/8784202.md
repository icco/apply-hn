# Ask HN: Junior/Entry-Level Android Engineers

Is there anyone hiring junior&#x2F;entry-level Android Engineer in the tech hubs such as SF, Seattle, NYC? I see most positions as senior and they always say they want more experience when I apply, especially in SF Bay Area. Even Google requires one year of work experience just to do Android&#x2F;iOS based on their job descriptions. I read the &quot;Who is Hiring?&quot; thread too and no one is hiring junior Android developers. Same situation when you search Indeed too. I guess no one needs them [in the tech hubs]?
