# Ask HN: Do I have to have a CS degree to be a software developer?

Hi.
I want to be a software developer, I&#x27;m currently a college student (I&#x27;m from the UK, so I&#x27;m technically a senior in highschool I think?), I&#x27;m 17 if that makes it easier. Anyway, I got a C in Maths, I wanted to go to Sussex University to study Computer Science but they need a B in maths. I can apply to Brighton University, but the modules at Sussex University look a lot better.<p>I&#x27;m really interested in compiler development, and I wanted to take compilers at university but I don&#x27;t think they do it at Brighton. Anyway, a few questions... is there are a chance I can still get into Sussex University if I show them my portfolio or something? I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m a somewhat competent programmer, and I contribute to a lot of open source projects.<p>My next question is that, do I even have to go to university to get a job in the field of software development? Or should I just apply for Brighton University? I kind of feel that school is boring, and I usually spend my time playing games or programming. Mostly the latter, is it weird that I find not programming an unproductive use of my time?
