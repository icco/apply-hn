There is no single website that I can visit to stay completely up-to-date with design.<p>I need to visit dribbble, behance to see which graphics are the most voted for today = what are the current trends. I need to visit designernews.com, reddit.com to see what are the most voted articles about design. Then I should go to sidebar.io and check out the links there, and finally I also should visit medium.com to check what are the trending design articles today.<p>It may take an hour or more to do all this but only then can I be sure that I am truly up-to-date with design.<p>SOLUTION:<p>With Elfinite we want to significantly reduce the time we have to spend to stay up-to-date with the topics that matter to us.<p>Elfinite continually collects links from the most popular online content providers (i.e. YouTube, HN, NYT) and checks the number of shares (total number of likes + shares + comments) on fb.<p>Finally, it rates each link by applying our algorithm (publishing time + growth number + number of shares ). The highest rated links are then published on the main page in the appropriate category.<p>ABOUT US:<p>There are two people working on this project right now. I am the programming guy, and @brtkbrtk is responsible for product management.<p>WHY WE ARE APPLYING:<p>First, we need money for AWS and marketing. Second, it would be great to learn more from folks who have built great tech businesses.<p>PRIOR WORK:<p>I was a manager at COMARCH SA (5500+ emp.) where we were developing teleradiology solution: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teleradiology.comarch.com&#x2F;" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;teleradiology.comarch.com&#x2F;</a>. I was fully responsible for this project.<p>𝕨𝕨𝕨.𝕖𝕝𝕗𝕚𝕟𝕚𝕥𝕖.𝕔𝕠𝕞  𝕨𝕨𝕨.𝕖𝕝𝕗𝕚𝕟𝕚𝕥𝕖.𝕔𝕠𝕞  𝕨𝕨𝕨.𝕖𝕝𝕗𝕚𝕟𝕚𝕥𝕖.𝕔𝕠𝕞
