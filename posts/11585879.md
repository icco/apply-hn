# Apply HN: Notisha â€“ Microlearning for Faith-Based Communities

Notisha is a microlearning platform for faith-based communities.<p>Here&#x27;s our demo video (<a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L4IxzMP4pSI" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=L4IxzMP4pSI</a>).<p>PROBLEM<p>1. Most believers have a very shallow understanding of what they believe in.<p>2. It&#x27;s very hard to find high quality, structured and spiritually nourishing content that can be consumed in between our busy schedules on a daily basis.<p>SOLUTION<p>We are creating a platform where a believer will be able to select up to 5 topics to learn from every day from different spiritual leaders&#x2F;teachers. The content is packaged in bite sized chunks as text or less than 5 minute video tips&#x2F;tutorials. We are starting with the marriage and relationships topic.<p>HOW WE MAKE MONEY<p>The first 2 teachings of the day are free, the next 3 are available on subscription.<p>STAGE<p>We are currently in the prototyping phase but will be releasing a mobile app within the next 7 days. Here&#x27;s the apk (<a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1SR0kPJ" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;bit.ly&#x2F;1SR0kPJ</a>) for the current build.<p>We&#x27;d love to hear from you on what you think about it.
