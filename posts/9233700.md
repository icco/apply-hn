# Ask HN: What is something simple you would pay for if it existed?

In other words, what is something simple you are missing now?<p>It could be an app, a piece of hardware, a food, or anything else within the realm of simple and feasible - just not implemented yet.<p>Chances are it does exist already, but perhaps it has not been marketed aptly or the functionality is not up to par with what you think is minimally acceptable.
