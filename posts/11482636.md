Our first product, Project Quant, teaches Accounting, Analytics and Economics in a gamified pizzeria setting. We find the classroom to be boring and un-engaging. What better way to learn business education than by actually managing a virtual company.<p>Our formula for engagement is bite sized learning, gamified environment, in-game course ware and subject integration. In Project Quant, the student will triple up as an economist, data scientist and accountant. We are looking for beta testers to use Project Quant. If you find it interesting, please contact : arun@mbaville.com, arunbharadwaj2009@gmail.com<p>We are a team of 2 co-founders from Purdue University: a MBA and a Masters in Computer Graphics technology. The MBA co-founder was an avid simulation gamer when young and believes that all of business education can be simulated on a massive multiplayer game featuring industries, economies and human behavior. The Computer Graphics co-founder has been building games all through his life and is very proficient in most programming languages.
