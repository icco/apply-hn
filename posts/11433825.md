# Ask HN: PDF-based notetaking apps for iPad Pro and Pencil?

Paper notebooks have long been an essential part of my software development workflow, and now I&#x27;d like to take them digital with the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil. Unfortunately, it seems that most of the notetaking apps on iOS are fairly proprietary: your sketches are stored in some hidden database or in the cloud, and the only way to get something standard out of them is to perform a clunky export. I&#x27;d like my notes to be in a standard format, and I&#x27;d like them to be editable directly; in other words, there should always be a 1:1 mapping between the files sitting in my Dropbox and the notes that the app is editing.<p>So I was wondering: are there any Pencil-supporting iOS apps that simply let you create a new, blank PDF — maybe even with a custom cover image — and then use it directly for sketching and perhaps even text and image entry? Huge bonus points for handwriting recognition!
