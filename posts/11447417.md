# Apply HN: FundChan.com â€“ funded channel messaging

FundChan is a messaging platform where messages are sent with an amount of money attached, like receiving a letter with a dollar included.<p>This addresses the problem of communication in asymmetric relationships -- I know you, but you don&#x27;t know me, so how do we open a channel of communication that works for both of us?<p>Enter FundChan.com, which is live and fully functioning at https:&#x2F;&#x2F;fundchan.com. (note: I have zero traction&#x2F;users, which is why I am applying to YC).<p>Here are examples of asymmetric relationships&#x2F;use-cases we may address:<p>In Hollywood: 
-- fan&#x2F;celebrity
-- waiter&#x2F;director<p>In Silicon Valley:
-- salesperson&#x2F;CEO
-- CEO&#x2F;investor<p>In World:
-- advertiser&#x2F;consumer<p>FundChan features person-to-person direct messaging as well as targeted public messaging.<p>I have been working on this project for over 10 years now, so, yes, I am obsessed. The project has also evolved and iterated over the years as my understanding and approach to the problem has changed, as well as my programming skills (php&#x2F;mysql).<p>Here is the video I submitted for my YC application:
