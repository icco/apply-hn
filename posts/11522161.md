# Apply HN â€“ LACKII

LACKII&#x27;s mission is to save startups time and money so that they can get back to changing the world. LACKII provides on-demand personal assistants and semi-skilled workers to startups working in co-working spaces. Co-working spaces contract with LACKII to have teams of Lackiis stationed at the co-working space. These Lackiis are available on-demand as an amenity for the member startups, or available to the startups for a slight increase in the membership fee (totally up to the co-working space).
