# Ask HN: Bought manufacturing biz â€“ how to bring into modern age?

I&#x27;m in process of completing an acquisition of a 30 year old manufacturing business. 9 employees.  Machine tools, some of which are CNC, some aren&#x27;t.  A bit over $1M in revenue.  (Single product type, but each product is customized for the end user.  Sorry for anonymity but not done with purchase yet.)<p>This business has not been brought into modern age.  Manual hand drawn designs for the products (which again, are done differently for each customer).  Old school hand recording of timesheets.  No HR system.  Accounting on quickbooks.  CRM is a paper file system.  No sales staff to speak of (just answer phones.)  7 step manufacturing process is done by moving hand written order forms along the production line for each step.<p>What would your priorities be as you took this over to apply all the best of breed productivity tools, SAAS tools, hacks, etc to bring this business into the modern age?
