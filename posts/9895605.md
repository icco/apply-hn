# Ask HN: How do you keep your mathematical knowledge sharp over time?

I am working on machine learning from the basics. I want to do it the right way and I am learning probability and statistics.  At school and college, mathematics was my favorite subject and I loved treating every problem as a new challenge leading to a fresh perspective.  Then life intervened. Now, after a few years, I realize, much to my chagrin, that most of the higher level math I had learned, has evaporated.  So there is much I have to relearn.  Also, unfortunately, unlike college, it is not possible for me to sit x hours everyday to learn.  Currently, I am learning in bursts, sometimes followed by long passive time.  So I often have to revise and reorient myself when I sit to study again. I would like to avoid this.  Has anyone faced this? How do you tackle it?<p>One solution seems to be using Spaced Repetition cards, like Anki.  But it to seems to have it&#x27;s limitations. http:&#x2F;&#x2F;lesswrong.com&#x2F;lw&#x2F;juq&#x2F;a_vote_against_spaced_repetition&#x2F;<p>Obviously, whatever I learn in math, I try to apply it to a lots of problems.  But inevitably, there is some fading of knowledge as time passes, and I might not be able to keep redoing the problems.<p>Please share your experiences. Thank you.
