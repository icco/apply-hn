# Apply HN: AccoSearch â€“ AI-Based O2O Search Engine

AccoSearch is an O2O search engine that helps you find the best place to buy things you want. It is similar to Yelp. But instead of asking you to search business names and categories, AccoSearch allows you to directly search for the product you are looking for. For instance, by typing &quot;leather jacket&quot;, AccoSearch will show you a list of leather jackets being sold in all stores around you. If you see one that you may like and would love to pay a nearby store a visit, we give you an address and navigation; if you want to order online, we give you a purchase link; if you want to see others&#x27; opinion about this product, we give you a list of reviews consolidated from various sources.<p>Our data are mined by our AI system, which automatically extracts product data from webpages using computer vision technologies. Almost all retailers (big and small, online and offline) post their product data on the Internet (their own websites, social media pages, and third-party sales platforms). But these data are scattered around and hard to find using traditional search engines if one does not know the exact name of a retail business.<p>We are in closed beta.
