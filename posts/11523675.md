# Apply HN: TheyMadeThat â€“ Non-Spammy Linkedin + IMDB

Problem:<p>1. The traditional resume is out of date. Digitizing it and overlaying a social network on top helps, but underneath it&#x27;s still an old resume. So what&#x27;s the problem with the traditional resume? The traditional resumes focus too much on job titles and the companies that gave you those job titles. It just doesn&#x27;t convey what you actually did well enough.<p>2. People don&#x27;t get credit for their work. What do we mean by that? Is everyone still willing to believe that only Steve Jobs and Jony Ive developed the iPhone? What about the hundreds of other engineers, designers, and executives behind it?<p>Enter TheyMadeThat:<p>We solve both problems by:<p>a. Focusing on your work instead of your tenure - even your kids (HR &amp; recruiters) can more easily understand what you do:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theymadethat.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;tony-fadell" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theymadethat.com&#x2F;people&#x2F;tony-fadell</a><p>b. By giving your work their own profiles, with important details such as history and evolution:<p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theymadethat.com&#x2F;things&#x2F;nest-learning-thermostat" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theymadethat.com&#x2F;things&#x2F;nest-learning-thermostat</a><p><a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theymadethat.com&#x2F;things&#x2F;apple-macintosh" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.theymadethat.com&#x2F;things&#x2F;apple-macintosh</a><p>To reduce the noise and spam; unlike LinkedIn, your social network on TheyMadeThat is simply the people that you have directly worked with on a project. It doesn&#x27;t matter if they worked at the same company as you, if you didn&#x27;t work with them on something then they&#x27;re not part of your network. Most importantly we are not going to spam you about whether or not you know &#x27;yet another random person&#x27;.<p>Feel free to test drive our alpha: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;theymadethat.com</a><p>(Just please don&#x27;t delete any data or add garbage data to our site. Yes we have database backups as well as version history for everything but we&#x27;d rather not have to roll anything back, since we already have mountains of other work to do.)
