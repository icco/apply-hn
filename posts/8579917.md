# Show HN: Endvr.io â€“ we're trying to make the recruitment process smarter

https:&#x2F;&#x2F;endvr.io<p>This is our MVP and we&#x27;re looking for feedback plus interesting opportunities.<p>Our service connects recruiters to talented folks in smarter ways than blanket emails or insincere LinkedIn messages.<p>We let talent specify hidden requirements such as salary and only let them be contacted when a recruiter or employer has something genuinely relevant to them. Those hidden requirements are never disclosed, only used by our system to connect people together.<p>Recruiters&#x2F;employers have to be up-front about their opportunities and we expect them to apply a reasonable code of practice; otherwise face a ban for wasting people&#x27;s time.<p>We believe there&#x27;s a real problem and we can help give people a better experience. Help us figure out how by giving us your invaluable feedback!<p>support@endvr.io
