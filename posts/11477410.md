# Apply HN: Gameplan â€“ Personal Learning Assistant for School Kids

The problem we are trying to solve is providing a more personal and improved learning experience to school students. The way this would work is if a student attends a lecture in class, she finds videos&#x2F;blogs&#x2F;articles from around the web on the same topic once she goes back home. Based on the type of content she chooses (small video vs long , blog vs video) we show her similar things. Apart from this teachers can set weak topics for each student and they get more content of that topic. Teachers and parents can monitor what content is being looked at by the kids.<p>We want to build this initially as a web app and then progress to a moodle plugin.<p>It is primarily for the Asian market.
