# Ask HN: Optimal way to get a job abroad(US/UK)  as an engineer? Advice please

I&#x27;m an electronics engineer who likes to work on embedded software, unfortunately where I am from(Peru) there are no jobs available on this area(apart from being a teacher assistant). So I&#x27;d like to work abroad.
But, as far as I know, the only way to do that is to go to grad school to another country, apply for an internship and then get the visa to stay there, so that&#x27;s currently my plan. The issue is  that I don&#x27;t enjoy doing research and writing papers; writing my undergraduate dissertation was a pain. So I was wondering if there is another way to achieve my actual goal without the intermediate step of going to grad school for 2 years.
