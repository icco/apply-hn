# Apply HN: Spread Code Review Load

<i>&quot;1 file code review, 50 comments; 50 file code review, no comments looks good to me.&quot;</i> Human nature is causing us to lose focus where focus is needed most.<p>&lt;Product&gt; takes your code reviews and gives your developers a small portion of them to focus on. If you have 10 developers, give each a single file to vet in your 10 file code review. Context is important, so each developer can still participate in the entire review - they&#x27;ll just be directed to focus on one part of it. For this reason, files pass a review - it is not a wholesale fail or pass. We&#x27;ll remember which files passed and let the next round of developers know.<p>Sometimes you need developers from a specific team to vet changes. Allocate those developers to a team and bring them into the fold for those reviews; spread knowledge by also including developers from other teams.<p>Got an open source project? Crowd source your reviews and possibly attract contributors by publishing to our hub. We&#x27;ll match reviewers based on their language and stack experience. We&#x27;ll still make sure that your developers are involved in every review.<p>We&#x27;re going to start off with GitHub, but will be expanding to other platforms in the future - including on-premise platforms such as Perforce and TFS.<p>Note: I am currently committed to a job. I am leaving this in the open for anyone who would like to pick it up.
