# Ask HN: Web dev's â€“ how often do you run your code?

For web developers: How often do you run your code? Due to the nature of hot code reload&#x2F;interpreted languages like PHP, how often do you find yourself flicking back to the browser to check on things?<p>Just curious. Despite knowing that 99% of the code I write will work as intended, I can&#x27;t help but play with whatever functionality I&#x27;m developing every few lines to make sure things are coming together correctly. Is this normal? Or do people knock out a load of code and run it all at the end?<p>I suppose test-driven development somewhat combats the need to check on things for reassurance and this doesn&#x27;t apply as much to front-end devs, since that&#x27;s a large part of the job.
