# Ask HN: So what's next?

We now know that many organizations gather information of everybody, they build profiles, analyze people&#x27;s metadata, they can put you in a bucket, apply a dozens of data-mining techniques to find targets, segments (which is only a nicer way to say simply people)<p>They can predict what are we going to do, when, and where..<p>We now know that metadata is the new commodity. There are data&#x27;s buyers, seller, middlemen.. and those that are outside the party keep gathering, you never know when it&#x27;s gonna be handy. They can even sell data to alleviate bankruptcy!!<p>Without getting into the discussion if this is good or bad, we can&#x27;t deny that this is already happening, and this will only get worse. Entities will keep expending on gathering data --even if it&#x27;s not part of their core business-- as long is cost effective (thanks Moore-law!), they will go on and on..<p>And don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;m not saying that these are evil. Some there are, some not. This is world-wide being disrupted by the information, like the steam machine did; no matter we like it, or not.<p>..which makes me wonder, if information is power and, now we know, so .. what&#x27;s next?
