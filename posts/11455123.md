# Apply HN: Eat My Dust - Home testing for dangerous materials

Problem: Is our home free of poisons and toxins?
Idea: At home testing for dangerous materials; customers fill a vial with vacuum dust and mail it to us. Our lab will test for lead, asbestos, or other containments that may be lurking in your home. We’ll also test your water for lead, mercury, pharmaceuticals, and other toxins. Customers can then work to improve their environment and test on a regular basis.
Market: Anyone who lives under a roof and cares about their family’s health.<p>About Us: Husband (data engineer) and wife (bioinformatist).  I’ve worked in startups and big companies solving data problems, my wife has built LIMS (lab information management systems) for pharma and bio-tech companies. We live in the SF Bay area, and we’re always concerned about the safety of our environment for ourselves and daughter, but haven’t been able to validate that our home is safe to live in.
