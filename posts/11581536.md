# Apply HN: Discovery List â€“ Product Hunt for products you can actually buy

Discovery List Beta: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.discoverylist.com<p>Problem: We&#x27;re targeting people with a spare $100 to spend and want to buy something unique and exciting. Online retailers like Amazon only work well when you know what you&#x27;re looking for. Discovering new products by trawling through product blogs and browsing Twitter feeds is inefficient since most of them cover the same products as each other.<p>Discovery List: provides 3 lists of user-submitted products (under $100, over $100, pre-orders) upvoted by other users. Each product has a price, description and buy link. Users can save products to a wishlist to find them later. Eventually, we want Discovery List to be a detailed directory of everything buyable on the internet.<p>Making Money: We make money when people buy products from our affiliate partners.<p>About Us: We&#x27;re two brothers who live in Melbourne, Australia. I&#x27;m an actuary who codes and my brother is a software engineer with a PhD.
