# Ask HN: GPA for MBA programs

So, I know most of you guys hate MBA programs, but I feel that there&#x27;s quite a bit business guys here that did it or intend do apply for it and I do have a question.<p>So here&#x27;s the deal. I&#x27;ve studied in Brazil in a college that&#x27;s famous for not inflating GPA and only about 20% of students who start CS end up finishing it(most of them quit and go study somewhere else easier), given that, I have around 2.3 GPA.<p>I know that I can get a good grade in GMAT, but does that mean that I&#x27;m pretty much fucked if I do want to apply for an MBA?<p>I could join a bad college just to get the good grades... GPA mean that much?
