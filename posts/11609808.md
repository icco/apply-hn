# Ask HN: What is happening with Apply HN?

The deadline for Apply HN submissions was April 27 (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=11440627), looks like new applications are not coming in, but the voting and commenting is still live. The main link https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;applyhn is showing random list on every visit and not a ranked list.<p>Given the small overall numbers on votes and comments – is this YC experiment in this execution considered a failure? Can we expect another iteration on the next YCF?<p>And what about startups that have submitted their ideas – has some of you received useful feedback or growing interest on your project?
