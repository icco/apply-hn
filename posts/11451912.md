# Apply HN: Patron â€“ Uber for the Service Industry

Patron- patronapp.org  Get Sh*t Done<p>I often find myself not having time to complete chores such as shopping and cleaning. Along with this I found it incredibly costly to hire a maid or caretaker therefore I founded Patron, an app that allows people to post tasks and set their own prices. Well who does the work? I&#x27;m doing what no other similar service on the market does, anyone can download the app and complete tasks to earn money. I am hoping to build Patron to be the Uber of the service industry where anyone can be their own boss and work on their own schedule.<p>Right now, I got a completely working application and am focusing on polishing it for publication.<p>How (are you going to make money): We take 10% of the total post cost.<p>Where (are the competitors): UberEats and Taskrabbit are our closest competitors. They all have the issue of quick expansion as they have an actual employee system.
