# Ask HN: Soon-to-be-graduate looking for some career advice

I live in India, and am about to complete a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in Computer Science. However, I don&#x27;t have a great GPA. I do however, have a few personal projects to my credit.<p>I wish to eventually work in the US (hopefully in Silicon Valley) with a great job. What are my chances of getting a job in the US directly after graduating college (in a month or so) as a foreigner?<p>I read elsewhere that it&#x27;s hard to do because unless I&#x27;m super special, not many companies are willing to sponsor a visa. If that&#x27;s true, I&#x27;ve decided to try to apply for grad school in the US about a year from now.<p>In which case, how can I improve my CV? I heard that doing some relevant research can really help. India isn&#x27;t really known for great research. Is it possible for me to apply for research abroad, given that my CGPA isn&#x27;t very good and that I&#x27;ve never done research before?<p>What are my options at this point? I&#x27;m willing to do whatever it takes.<p>For grad school, fields like Distributed Computing and Human-Computer Interaction really interest me. Please tell me what I can do at this point.<p>Thank you.
