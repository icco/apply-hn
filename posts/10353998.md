# Ask HN: How to get an out of state internship?

Hi all, I&#x27;m currently a Junior Software engineering student and I&#x27;m looking to find an internship out of state for this coming summer. I&#x27;m at a point where I want to experience more outside of what my area of Milwaukee, Wi has to offer when it comes to software, business, and also culture and the people that come with it.<p>I&#x27;m looking to learn more about mobile development and I am currently dabbling in Xamarin mobile development. Are their any tips that I should keep in mind when looking for an out of state internship? I find it difficult to find these out of state positions when typically all I can do is apply online and get pooled with many other candidates.<p>Any input from this community would be wonderful.
