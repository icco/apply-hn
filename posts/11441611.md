# Apply HN: Protoship.io â€“ generate entire front end (HTML/CSS/React) from designs

You are a web developer - back-end&#x2F;front-end&#x2F;unicorn. You&#x27;re good, you&#x27;re fast, you have many years under your belt. Yet, building even the simplest of web applications is still a time-consuming chore. It is not the code, programming is always fun. But it is the tedium of writing and tweaking HTML and CSS that takes up most of your time (and money).<p>Protoship generates clean HTML, CSS, and even reusable React components for you, straight from design. No measuring of margins and paddings, no extracting and assembling of assets, and none of that pixel-perfection worries. Drop in a .sketch file, name your components, and it is done.<p>We have a video of a really early version here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;medium.com&#x2F;sketch-app-sources&#x2F;code-generator-to-create-react-projects-straight-from-design-with-clean-html-and-css-c399a8189f0d#.kgvfikpvf<p>Our Homepage: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;protoship.io&#x2F;#products<p>We are two developers who want to make useful things on the web without being bogged down by automatable, routine work.
