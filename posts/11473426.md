# Apply HN: ThinkSquare – Let AI help you find your next job

Url: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thinksquare.io<p>Problem: Existing job search platforms i.e. job boards, Linkedin, still require a manual search where the user has to look through a majority of jobs they don’t want to find the minority they will actually apply to.<p>Hiring companies receive a lot of unqualified applicants at the top of the hiring funnel and waste time going through resumes that don’t belong in the talent pool.<p>Solution: Our platform saves you the effort by taking one profile and matching it with all the jobs on our system which fit your skills, experience and preferences.<p>No cover letters, or editing your resume for each application. Simply review the returned matches and confirm your profile’s submission.<p>Manage all communication in one place, from direct messaging hiring companies to accepting or scheduling interviews.<p>Companies on our platform only receive qualified applicants and can spend more time determining which candidate is a good fit rather than who doesn’t belong in the talent pool.<p>Our system only matches applicants who fit their set preferences, such as core skills or past experience, and filter out the others.<p>Demo: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thinksquare.io&#x2F;demo<p>If you have any questions or feedback, please don&#x27;t hesitate to reach out or leave a comment :)
