www.ReviewFairy.com<p>I see user acquisition as a function of traffic and conversion. Conversion is hurt by the trust needed for my business (reviewers pay first and then get reimbursed) and probably a host of other things. If you see any easily fixable trust-blockers, please let me know :)<p>I am most curious about traffic channels. Though. Does anyone have any experience advertising to heavy online-shoppers? I&#x27;ve tried ads but cost per customer has been pretty high. I&#x27;ve tried to apply the Traction framework, but it&#x27;s been a tough battle.<p>I am new to the startup world, so any help or feedback would be most appreciated! And if anyone wants to get some of the coolest new tech products for free - please sign up :)
