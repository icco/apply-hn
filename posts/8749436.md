# Ask HN: “Unofficial” second year CS student applying for technical internships

As a brief intro, I majored in economics in my first two years, went to a business program in my third year, stayed for a year. Over this summer, I took two first year CS courses (prerequisites for all 2nd year CS). Transferred to a CS program starting this Sept., taking mostly second year CS courses and two third year CS courses. So basically my CS knowledge level is at a second year level, but my official year is 4th year. I will finish the CS program and graduate in 2 years (2016). I have several business-related (tech consulting over this summer) internships over the past 4 summers since high school.<p>Starting this year, I have been starting working on side projects (web apps) but mostly front-end stuff for now. I have applied to Google&#x27;s Engineering Practicum program and was informed that I wasn&#x27;t eligible because I was not going to be graduating in 2017 or 2018. I was debating on applying for the normal SE positions because of my limited technical skills holding me back. I applied to several product manager intern positions as well.<p>If i want to apply for technical positions, what would be the strategy (target companies, positions, etc...)? What other suggestions do you guys have in terms of my current focus and priority?<p>Thanks a lot! Really appreciate it!
