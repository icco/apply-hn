# Ask HN: Should I drop out of my second bachelors?

Currently in my late 20s and will be transferring from a community college to my local UC for my second bachelors, which will be completed in March of 2017. First degree was from the same school with unrelated, non-math, non-engineering degree.<p>Had a talk with my friend who is in the industry, and he said I should just start applying for jobs and teaching myself instead of wasting money. For jobs like web and mobile dev, it makes less sense to go for a full CS degree, since in those fields you can showcase your work and get hired a lot easier. I currently have one app in the app store and I&#x27;m active in open-source, however I still feel a little too green to start applying yet.<p>So now I&#x27;m stuck in the middle. I quit my job in January 2015, and I feel like I am at the halfway mark of completing the CS degree. I feel like I am already in too deep to turn back.<p>If I do apply, I won&#x27;t be able to start until late March 2016, which is when I&#x27;ll be done with my first quarter at my university. Fees are already paid and I don&#x27;t want to drop out in the middle of a quarter. How do I format my resume in a way that I want to put my schooling on hold, especially when they see on their that I am currently attending school?<p>Is this the right choice?
