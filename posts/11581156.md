# Apply HN: Keep your all meetings short

Meetings are killer of productivity at work.<p>The idea is to do meetings with defined rules: meeting can&#x27;t be longer than 15 minutes, there has to be a clear goal defined for the meeting, presentation at the meeting should be short (no more than 10 slides, with only one large font available (32)), presenter should be prepared, all comments are at the end of the meeting (or through the app).<p>App will force user who schedule a meeting to prepare it according to the rules. App will help user to prepare slides and will help with speech preparation (by time, tone tracking). During the meeting app will keep meeting to be on time and will allow to add comments which will be answered during meeting (if there will be time) or after.<p>Dont waste other people time, be prepared, follow the qoute:
&#x27;If I had more time, I would have written a shorter letter.&#x27;
