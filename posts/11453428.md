# Apply HN: Finac – Codecademy Meets Finance

FINAC  is a financial education platform. We’re taking a &quot;Codecademy meets Finance&quot; approach in educating. Codecademy, Udacity and similar sites have made programming easy and cool. We want to do the same for finance.We take the mystery out of the financial world by making the concepts and terminologies transparent and making it fun and easy to understand.<p>The financial world is full of complicated jargon which a layman struggles to understand and yet is heavily invested (pun intended) in it. So many financial instruments are available, yet their utility is redundant if nobody knows how to use them. It’s like giving somebody a car and not teaching them how to drive. We believe now is the RIGHT time for such a platform when people can invest and trade just using their mobile phones at almost negligible costs. But at the same time they need the knowledge to do so.<p>Check out: <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefinac.tk" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.thefinac.tk</a>  (our prototype- we would love your feedback!)
