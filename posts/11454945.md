# Apply HN: Echo Cut â€“ Content curation that reduces media bias

The Name, from Echo Chamber and Paper Cut.<p>The Pain point.  Everyone considers news these days to be very biased politically and often it is.  However, instead of pulling away from this bias people more and more are gravitating towards it.<p>The Idea.  Create a news curation site organized by topic of the day, i.e. Panama Papers, Justice Scalia dying, debates, etc. Everything starts in the middle and readers decide if the article is left or right.  This will then cause the articles with bias to move to the right or left of the page.  The goal is for more people to read other sources and for writers and articles that are fair to remain in the middle.
