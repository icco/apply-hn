# Ask HN: I got kicked out of an Ivy League, now what?

I got withdrawn from the Engineering program at an Ivy League because of my grades. Looking back, it was completely my fault, but I can&#x27;t change that now. I was transitioning from a &quot;core&quot; engineering major to CS but before I could, I was asked to leave. I&#x27;ve applied for transfers but lets see where that goes. I&#x27;m a fairly decent coder, getting better and better now that I have nothing else to do, and I want to know if its even necessary to have a university degree at the end of the day. Do employers really care where you went to school as long as you have a great portfolio of projects you&#x27;ve worked on? Also if anyone knows of any programs or universities I could apply to that would seriously consider me despite my situation, that would be helpful, especially if they are tech&#x2F;entrepreneurial programs (like makeschool).
