# Ask HN: Moving to the next level

So, imagine this https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;enrmarc&#x2F;minesweeper-api is a &quot;real&quot; product&#x2F;service. Call it THE_APP. Just for the sake of this post, imagine that THE_APP does &quot;something valuable&quot; and people would love to pay for it (ignore that it&#x27;s just a pseudo minesweeper api).<p>I know how to write code. I don&#x27;t write excellent code. I&#x27;m getting paid for writing decent code. I&#x27;m not very experienced programmer. I know things like OOP, FP, MVC, patterns, Ruby, type systems, http, Java, Android, Scheme, databases, JS frameworks, eval&#x2F;apply, PHP, etc.<p>Now, I have no idea about: scalable architectures, how to deal with hundred of thousands of users, db replication, real time, https&#x2F;ssl, cloud, message systems like zmq, security... in summary I have no idea how to make THE_APP a service that could work in a happy real situation (millions of users, a lot of data, etc).<p>So my question is: how I can learn all of those things?
