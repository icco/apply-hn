# Ask HN: After working for myself what job positions am I suitable for?

I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been working for myself for about 6 years now, developing my own ideas into successful mobile applications (over 3 million paid downloads). I&#x27;m now looking to move on from this as I&#x27;m a little burnt out and I would like to work with more people again. The issue I currently have is wondering what positions I should apply for.<p>Although I studied in computer science and assumed I would be a programmer, I find that for me, programming is a means to an end, the end being getting an idea into something real. For my current apps I take them through the full lifecycle myself, from idea, to feature requirements, UI design, programming, marketing, release and then the direction of where they should go in future updates. So I have quite a broad set of skills and experiences, yet besides under my own business my only other work has been in web development.<p>While looking at job positions I&#x27;m questioning if employers will see that I have anything besides programming to offer and if I would be capable of working in a more product development&#x2F;management oriented role.
