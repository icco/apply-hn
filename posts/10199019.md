# Ask HN: Existing convertible note advantage or obstacle for YC?

We applied for the previous YC batch, but didn&#x27;t get in. Now we have an opportunity to receive a $75000 convertible note loan from a national trust. However, we&#x27;d like to apply for the W16 batch, and we&#x27;re wondering whether this increases or decreases our chances of being accepted?<p>Thanks
