If we removed wages and time as a proxy for value, everyone would make more money. This is not about social Justice.We aim to replace wages with mini X-prizes.<p>Why would business prefer this?
-Fire prevention Vs Fire Fighting-- code is done well once and for all.
-Less operating capital-- free from pressure of monthly salary expense.
-Programmers who speak up--- less waste from boss&#x27; ego features.
- Deeper talent pool-- Have a whole &#x27;guild&#x27; look into your problem vs only the persons you have hired&#x2F;contracted.<p>Benefit to programmers
-Direct attribution to profit and growth.
-Keep more of your paycheck Vs burning it on high rent. 
-Automate yourself out of a job and earn perpetual royalties.
-Build apprentices- nurture and discover talent to take over from you.<p>If tech and AI are about efficiency and driving costs down, then wage free prog(workers) will accelerate us to the new  golden age.
