# Ask HN: How Do I Improve?

I&#x27;m a sophomore university student in computer science, but only seriously started studying the field upon entering college. I&#x27;ve worked hard to apply myself and leverage my resources, but being surrounded by so many smart and experienced people and struggling to find internships for the coming summer has been discouraging lately.<p>So HN, how do you choose what skills to improve (whether for fulfillment or employability), and how do you go about improving in an efficient and effective manner?
