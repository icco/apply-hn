No discoverability for independent artists.<p>Solution : A better Web torrent with NO CLIENT install - completely decentralized.  Video not stored in the cloud, but by other consumers.  Not ad based, but crypto currency  (which would allow FAIR and open method for content creators to directly allow advertising sponsorship).
Videos that you like are discoverable by your friends even if it is not viral.
