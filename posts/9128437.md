# Ask HN: My app is shared on Twitter every day. What should I do?

I created an app last year that gained some popularity on Hacker News thankfully. I&#x27;m in a transition phase. I work full-time and I have a side job I&#x27;m finishing up for a client. Soon I can concentrate on building my next version.<p>My problem is it&#x27;s shared on Twitter, but it has bugs and it&#x27;s not good enough to begin marketing yet. I&#x27;m learning Swift to build the 2nd version, but I&#x27;m not an iOS coder, so the build is slow going. I&#x27;ve had a ton of feedback and I have the design and features of the next version planned.<p>Should I pursue seed funding? Should I apply to an accelerator? Should I look for a partner to help with coding? I don&#x27;t have much money, but should I hire someone? I&#x27;ve looked at the analytics and the market segment is pretty clear. It makes me a little nervous to see the social sharing without much real ability to capitalize on it. I&#x27;m not sure how long Buffer will keep it in the suggested articles rotation (although it seems like it&#x27;s been 6 months now). It&#x27;s shared on Twitter and LinkedIn almost everyday for at least 3 months. I feel like the opportunity is slipping away.<p>I may be overreacting, but hopefully you can understand my anxiety. You can see the shares by searching Twitter for &quot;rememberwinapp.com&quot;.
