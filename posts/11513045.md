# Apply HN: Robin â€“ Banking for Children Focused on Education

Kids&#x27; bank accounts require tedious processes and does not teach him&#x2F;her about saving. Children just receive money and spend it without much thinking and the parent is not much involved other than depositing monthly allowances.<p>Robin is an educational tool for children to learn while they do, all while being supported and guided by us and their parents. 
Parents can set &quot;Quests&quot; or tasks, kids access a planning tool linked to a wishlist to foresee their expenses, and ask for parent loans with different interest rates depending on their level.<p>We believe kid&#x27;s finances are not about transactions but rather education.<p>You can check our demo here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;UxF-V49nmkI<p>If you are interested, sign up for a private beta: robinapp.co<p>We will appreciate your feedback, please leave a comment.
